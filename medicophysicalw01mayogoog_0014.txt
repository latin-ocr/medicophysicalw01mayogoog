Preface v

OpinionS. It is dated Oxford, 12th February 1790,
two years before his resignation of the readership in
chemistry. Resides Beddooe we have Dr J. B. A.
Scherer, physician in Vienna, who in 1793 published
Bewerk, dass J. Mayow vor 100 Jahren den Grund
zur antipblogistzkcben Chemie und Physiologie gelegt
hat, and also G. D. Yeats, MR. of Hertford College,
Oxford, physician at Bedford, who in 1798 published
Observations on the Claims qs the rlIodems tv some
Discoveries in Chemzlvtry and Physiology.

Beddoes quotes from Blumenbach's Institutiones
Physzblogzkoe, 1787, the following remarkable
passage: “Magna jam pars memorabilium horum
phaenomenorum,” says he, speaking of respiration,
“quibus nuperis lustris et physica de aeribus factitiis
disciplina et physiologia negotii respirationis tam
egregie ditata et illustrata est, jam ante centum et
quod excurrit annos innotuit acutissimi ingenii
medico Joanni Mayow, cujus de sal-nitro et ,spiritu
nitro-aereo (quo nempe nomine dephlogisticatum
aerem insignivit) tractatum, Oxon. 8vo editum,
magna cum voluptate legi et relegi.’'

But these attempts to make Mayow and his work
known to the scientific and medical world were not
crowned with much success·

Mayow is indeed mentioned, and his work is
discussed, in most books on the History of Chemistry ;
but as far as we have been able to discover, not many
chemists or physiologists have made anything like an
intimate personal acquaintance with his writingS.
Qnite recently a considerable part of the treatise on
nitre has been translated into German and published

by Prof. Donnan (Ostwald’s Klassiker der exakten ·

Wzlrsenschasten, Nr. 12 5, 1901). We had begun the
