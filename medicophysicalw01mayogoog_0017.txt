under water and in a place free from air, p. 9. The flame of
nitre is produced by the igneo-aerial particles contained in

it, p. 10. But not by sulphureous particles, as nitre does
. not contain such, p. 10. For the production of flante
sulphureous and igneo-aerial particles are required, p, 11.
Sulphureous matter cannot be set on lire without aerial
pabulum, p. 11. Why, for the kindling os nitre, it is not so
much air, as sulphureous matter, that is required, p, 11.
Why the flame of nitre is so impetuouS, p. 12, The ὅπως
of external air promotes the kindling of nitre, p. 12. The
igneo-aerial particles contained in nitre seem to constitute its
aerial part, p. 13 ; see pp. 82 and 83. The aerial and igne0us
part of nitre exists in the spirit of nitre, p. 13. The spirit ο(
nitre is compound‚ derived partly [rom terrestrial matter, but
also partly from the air, p. 13. Why the igneous particles os
air should be called nitro-aerial spirit, p. 14, The caustic
character of the spirit of nitre arises from its aerial part,
namely‚ from its igneo-aerial particles, p. 14, Why that
spirit, in distillation, appears of a ruddy colour, p, 14
Why spirit ol nitre does not go on lire although it mmains
igneous particles, p. 14.

CHAPTER Ill-01 THE NATURE on Nrcno-Altnmc
Ano lenaeus Semta.

It is shown that the igneo-aedat spirit is ol a nitro-saline
character, p. 16. Yet the igneo-aerial salt is neither acid
nor alkaline, p. 16. The form of flame chiefly depends on
the nitro-aerial particles, p. 16. lt can be produced from a
certain kind of particles only, p. 17. What part the sulphu-
reous particles take in the production of fire, p. 17. What is
the essence of dre, p. 18. The caustic nature os spirit of nitre
and of fiame arises from the same igneo-aerial particles, p. 18.
Why we think of the sulphureous rather than of the aerial
particles as hurning, p. 19. It is shown by experiments that fire
is especially produced by nitro-aerial particleS, p. 19. On the
lire produced by the rays of the sun concentrated by means

osa minor, p. 20. Why antimony calcined by the solar
rays becomes diaphoretic and increases in weight, p. 20.
