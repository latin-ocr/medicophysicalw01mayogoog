On the fleshy libres of muscles, p. 235. Description of
the fibrils, p. 235. They seem primarily to undergo con·
traction, p. 236. The oblique position of the fibres is less
fit sor the contractiori of the muscle, p. 236. But the posi-
tion of the fibrils is fitted for this, p. 236. The muscle is
drawn together by the contractiou oi the fibrils, p. 237.
The fibrils are eminently suited for producing tbe contrac-

blood, p. 240. How the blood passes through the muscles,
p. 240. lt does not seem to be extravasated, p. 240. It
