On Sal Nitrum and Νίίνο-Αέτίαῖ Spr'rit 3

constituent elements. For if the aeid spirit of ultre is
poured upon any alkali, or, in place of the alkali, upon
purely saline volatile salt, from the mutual strile ol
these two things coming together and the intense
action, sal nitrum is generated, which will readily
deflagrate when thrown into the lire. So that nitre
would seem to be born fit for fights and hostile
encounters, since it derives its'origin from the mutual
conflict of opposing elements and from enmity
itsell.

The constituents of nitre having been in this way
considered, let us next inquire how sal nitrum is
produced in the earth. For from‘almost any soil
impregnated by the air and the weather, but especially
from such as abounds in sulphur and fixed or volatile
salt, as that from 'stables, dovecots, and slaughter-
houses, sal nitrum is abundantly derived, and lrom
its source is well called sal ταντα». ’

As to the mode in which nitre originates in the
earth, the generally received opinion is that the earth
as its proper matrix draws sal nitrum from the air iu
virtue of its own attractive force. And, indeed, there
can be no doubt whatever that the air contributes in
no small degree to the generation of nitre, since nitre is
only evolved from soil which is impregnated with air.
Moreover, if earth from which all the nitre has been
lixiviated be exposed to the air, it will after some lapse
of time abound once more in nitre.

But, assuredly, one can scarcely suppose that the
nitre itsell is all 'derived from the air, but merely its
more volatile and subtle part, the rest of the nitre
being due to the earth, for of the nitre obtained from
the earth, by no means the least part is a fixed salt
which is not volatilised by the very hercest fire. For
in the distillation of nitre, only the aeid spirit of
