· the nitre is volatilised, the fixed salt being left in the
retort. And there is no ground for saying that the
nitre of the air is of a more volatile nature than ordi·
nary nitre. For if earth from which all the nitrous
salt has been lixiviated is exposed to the air, sal
nitrum, not volatile, 1 say, but fixed and of the ordi-
nary sort, will after some lapse of time be produced.
Consequently, if that nitre were wholly derived from
the air, then nitre of the more fixed sort, that is,
common nitre, must reside in the air, but that such
should fly about in the very rare air is not to be sup-
posed. But you may say that the same nitre which
is volatile when flying about in the air, becomes fixed
in the earth. But I would ask how that can take
place, unless something fixed from the earth be added
to the volatile nitre of the air? And what else is
this, but saying that the volatile part of the nitre is
. derived from the air, while its more fixed part is derived
from the earth?

To this we further add that if nitre, such as is
extracted from the earth, resided iu the air, thenas
the aerial nitre, whatever it be, mixes with kindled
fires (for the aerial nitre becomes food for the lire), it
would necessarily follow that every flame, even the
mild flame of a lamp, would constantly detonate on
account of the nitrous particles mixed with it; yet
this does not take place.

From these considerations it seems to be established
that sal nitrum is derived partly from the air and
partly from the earth, and this will appear still clearer
from what follows

Let us consider then, in the next place, what part
of the nitre is contributed by the earth, and, also,
what is contributed by the air. With regard to this, ι
it is our opinion that the fixed salt of which nitre in
