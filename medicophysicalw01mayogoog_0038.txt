part consists, is derived from the earth-and for this
reason, that it cannot, as we have already indicated,
reside in the very rare air on account of its highly
fixed nature. lt favours this view that from earth
impregnated with fixed or volatile salt, as from stables
⁸ and also from soil containing quicklime or ashes, sal ·
nitrum is lixiviated in greater abundance than from
any other soil, because these salts, united in course of
time with nitro-aerial spirit in a way to be explained
below, are converted into nitre. And, indeed, it is
probable that ashes, quicklime, and the like, fertilise
the soil, for this reason only, that they afford fixed
salt for the productiori of nitre, as will be shown
below.

Here, perhaps, some one will object that if earth
from which all the salts have been lixiviated is ex-
posed to the air, sal nitrum will, after some time, be
produced in it anew.

I reply that seeds of fixed salts exist, although
obscurely, in all soil, even in that which has been
lixiviated, and that these, by the force of a sort of
abrial ferment, are digested in course of time into
fixed salt, as l shall endeavour to show below. That
the earth is impregnated with a certain universal seed,
fecundating all things, has long been a received
opinion. Why, then, not suppose that this macro-
cosmic seed is either itself fixed salt or, at least, the
seeds of fixed salts hidden in the bosom of the earth3
'and that these when brought in progressos time to
maturity are, together with nitro-aerini spirit, changed
into sal nitrum. And it is a proof of this that nitre
generated in the bowels of the earth contributes in uo
small degree to the growth of plantS, as will be shown
below. For as metallic seeds he're and there dispersed
through the mass of the earth are in the course of
