6 Mayow

time converted into perfect metals‚ it is in like manner
probable that seeds of fixed salts lie deep hidden in
every fertile soil as in a suitable matrix, and that they
by long digestion and the influx of air are changed
into fixed salts. For in no other way can we conceive
whence there should arise such an abundance ol fixed
salts as is usually obtained by lixiviation from the
ashes of burned plants. For certainly none of these
salts can proceed from another source than the earth.
Indeed, it is probable that earth, pure and simple, is
nothing else than sulphur and fixed salt united
together in the closest bonds, and that both are held
together in so firm a union that it is only alter a long
period ol fermentation‚ set up by the air and the
weather‚ that they reach a state of activity. But this
will be discussed more fully below. And, at any rate,
if sulphur and fixed salt are melted hya gentle heat,
there results from their union a mixture of a dark

purple colonr, very like a clod ol earth-the only
difference‚ perhaps, being that earth is composed of
sulphur and fixed salt, both immature, and united
together by a closer hond.
