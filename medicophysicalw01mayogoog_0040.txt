Fr'rrt, of its adrialpart.

IN the previous chapter we treated generally ol the
elements of which nitre is composed, and specially
ol its more fixed part, the sal alkalr', to wit. Let us
look, in the next place, at the source of the other
clement of the nitro—viz„ its aeid spirit. Regarding
this, I was lor some time in doubt whether nitrous
spirit in a state ol the finest subdivision did not reside
in the air and, fleeting to and fro and permeating all
things in virtue of its most penetrating nature, instantly
assail, whether from hate or rather from some con-
jugal affection, whatever fixed or volatile salt it at any
time encountered in its wandering path 3 and whether
these two, closely united together, did not appear to
coalesce in a terrram quid, to wit, common nitre.
And assuredly there are arguments of no little weight
which can be advanced in support of this hypothesis.
For any other source than the air for the acid spirit of
nitre is scarcely conceivable‚ since sal m'trum is gener-

an acid salt. It is also to be noted that all salts what-
ever, fixed and volatile, as also vitriols‚ if calcined to
the complete expulsion of the aeid spirits, acquire
