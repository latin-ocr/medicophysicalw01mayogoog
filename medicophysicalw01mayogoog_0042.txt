food. For since there is more room for receiving the
smoke in the empty glass than in the glass that is lull
“ of air, the lamp would go out in the latter sooner than
in the former, if its extinction were due to the smoke.
Besides, no sulphureous matter, if placed in a glass
from which the air bas been pumped, can be kindled
either by ignited charcoal or iron, or by the solar rays
collected by means of a burning-giam, so that there
can be no doubt whatever that certain aerial particles
are quite indispensable to the productiori of fire, and,
indeed, it is our opinion that these are mainly instru-
mental in the production of lire, and that the shape
of the flame is mainly dependent upon these,
thrown into extremely brisk motion, as will be ex·
plained at greater length below. But it is not to be
supposed that the air itself, but only that its more
active and subtle part is the igneo-aerini food, since a
lamp enclosed in a glass goes out when there is still
an ample enough supply of air in it, for neither is it
to be believed that the particles of air which existed
in the said glass are annihilated by the burning ol the
lamp, nor yet that they are dissipated, since they are
unable to penetrate the glass. Further, it is impos·
sible that these igneo-aerial particles are any perfect
nitre, as is generally supposed—for it was already
pointed out that not the very nitre asa whole, but
only a certain part of it, resides in the air.¹

ln the second place, it would be reasonable to suppose
that the igneous particles of air necessary to the support
of all flame reside in sal nitrum and constitute its more

Δ active and fiery part, for it is to be noted that nitre

mixed with sulphur deflagrates readily enoughgin a
glass which does not contain air, and also under water,
as will be established by the following experiment;
'for let gunpowder, very finely ground, be made
