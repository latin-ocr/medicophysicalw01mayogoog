into a hardish mass with a little water, and let a
small tube, closed at one end, be densely filled with
it by forcibly ramming the stulf in with a stielr.
Next, let that gunpowder be set on lire at the open
end of the tube, and the tube be inverted and plunged
into water, and kept there. Then the gunpowder will
. deflagrare under water until it is all gone. Moreover,

that powder, arranged in the manner aforesaid, will
burn in a glass containing no air, although other fires
are presently extinguished because the aerial food is
withdrawn-—a sufficiently clear prool that sal nitrum
contains in itself the igneo-aerial particles necessary
to the productiori of flame3 so that for its deflagra-
tion there is no need for a supply ol igneous particles
from the air.

That igneo-aerial particles exist in nitre is further
evident from this, that flame produced by deflagrating
nitre is caused by the igneo-aerial particles residing in
it and bursting out in a compact body with fiery
motion, but not by its sulphureous particles. For it
is probable that nitre has no sulphureous particles as
ingredients; for 1 cannot agree with the famous Dr
Willis, who has stated in his treatise on Fermentation
that there is a great deal of sulphur in nitre. His
principal arguments are these-that if nitre is thrown
upon the fire it will immediately produce a flame, and
that it is especially generated in places where there
are sulphureous animal excrements. But, with all
due respect to so eminent a man, I should have
thought that nitre, pure and simple, is in no wise irn-
pregnated with sulphureous particles. For neither in
the rectified spirit of nitre nor in pure sal alkalz’ is
any combustible sulphur to be found ; and yet, from
the combination of these two, nitre will be produced.
But, because nitre produced in this manner will defla-
