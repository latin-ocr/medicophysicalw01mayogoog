On Sal llsr'trum and Nitro-Adrr'al spirit 11

grate, we cannot believe that this results from
sulphureous particles, for it contains none, but from
the igneo-aerial particles contained in it and thrown
into very rapid motion. And this will be made still
clearer by what follows. ’
For it is to be noted that for the productiori of any
dame, it is absolutely necessary, as has been already
pointed out, that there should henot only sulphureous

particles, but also igneo-adrial particles. To kindle ’

any sulphureous matter, igneo-aerial particles must
be supplied, either from the air or from nitre pre-
viously added. And this is the reason why sulphur
will not take fire in a vacuum unless nitre has been
mixed with it. But, on the other hand, for the
kindling of nitre there is no need lor igneo-aerial
particles to be supplied from without, because it will
deflagrate readily enough in places from which air is
excluded. But for its kindling it is quite indispens-
able that some sulphureous matter be mixed with it.
Foris nitre be thrown into a heated crucible it will
not take fire. If, however, any sulphureous matter be
previously mixed with it, then the nitre, when thrown
into the said crucible, will immediately burst into
flame. Nay, nitre can in no wise be kindled by the
llame of a candle, or by the solar rays, unless sulphur
has been previously mixed with it. And yet the
same nitre if thrown upon charcoal will be easily set
on fire; but this happens because the sulphureous
particles ol the charcoal ignite it. From these con·
siderations it is undoubtedly established that nitre
has no sulphureous particles contained in it, and this
is why, for its deflagration, sulphureous particles must
be supplied from without. And hence it follows that

nitre supplies in the flame excited by it the igneo· ’
- aerial particles only, but by no means the sulphureous
