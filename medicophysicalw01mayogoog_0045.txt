particles, ol which it is altogether destitute. And
hence it is that the flame ol nitre is very different
from that which is produced by any deflagrating
sulphureous matter. For sulphureous matter burns
when igneo-aerini particles are supplied from the air,
but nitre from the igneo-aerial particles closely packed
in itself and breaking forth in densest array. Hence
it is that the flame of nitre is exceedingly impetuous.
That the form of flame depends mainly on the igneo·
aerial particles, Ι shall attempt to show later.

But the reason why nitre is chiefly produced in
places that are largely imbued with sulphur will be
evident from what follows.

Since this treatise was written, Boyle's experimenta
recently published have come into our hands. In the
second of these it is shown that when gunpowder is
kindled, by means ol a burning-glass, in a glass freed
from air, the flame is not propagated, as in other cases,
through the whole ol its mass, but that only those
grains on which the collected solar rays fall take fire.
So that it appears that the access of air is necessary
even for the kindling of gunpowder. Ι reply that
although that powder will deflagrate by means of the
igneo-aerial particles residing in it, in a place where
there is no air, and under water, still the accessos
external air contributes in no small degree to its
kindling. For it is to be noted that air, on account
of its great elastie power, lies in the closest proximity
to the sulphureous particles of the gunpowder and
even presses powerfully against them, whence it is
that when the powder is once ignited in free air
nitro-aerial particles of the air are never lacking to
keep up the flame; while, on the other hand, the
igneo-aerial particles in gunpowder are intimately
blended with the sulphureous particles only in the in·
