dividual grains, and are not carried to those that are
kindled; so that the flame of the powder is speedily
extinguished in a vacuum, owing to a break in the
continuity of the igneo-nitrous particles. But how
greatly the elasticity of the air helps to produce fire· ·
will be more fully established by what will be said
below.

From what has been already said, it is, I think, to
some extent proved that nitre contains in itsell the
igneo-aerial particles required for the productior] of
flame. Wherefore, since some part of nitre is derived
lrorn the air and igneo-a‘e‘rial particles exist in it, it
seems we should affirm the proposition that the ae'n'al
part of nitre is nothing else than its agneo-aenol
partz'cles.

But now since the aerial part ol nitre exists in its

aeid spirit, but notin the fixed salt, which, as we have
already shown, forms the rest of the nitre, we may
conclude that the z‘gneo-ae'rz‘al particles ο] nitre, which
are identical with its aerial part, are halden in the
spirit ⁰f nitre, and constitute its adrt'ctl part.
ι Indeed, it is probable that the spirit of nitre isa
compouud, and that some of its particles are flexile,
humid, and of a grosser nature, being apparently
derived from terrestrial matter-as I shall endeavour
to show below-but that other particles are rigid,
dry, and extremely subtle, agile, ethereal, and really
igneous, and yet, being united with saline particles in
afluid and moist condition, are unfitted for entering
on a fiery movement, and that these at any rate are
derived from the air.

With regard then to the aerial part of nitrous spirit,
we maintain that it isnothing else than the igneo·
aerial particles which are quite necessary lor the
production of any flante. Wheresore, let me hence-
