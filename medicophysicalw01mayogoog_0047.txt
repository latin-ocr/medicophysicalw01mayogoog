forth call the fiery particles, which occur also in air,
nitro-aerial particles or nitro-aerial spirit.

For, indeed, the spirit of nitre seems to derive its
caustic and very potent fiery nature from the nitro-
aerial and fiery particles which reside in it. So that
it is commonly, and not improperly, called potential
fire. And, indeed, when nitre mixed with sulphur is
set on fire, it is probable that the nitro-aerini particles
ol this impetuous flame proceed frorn the nitrous
spirit, since the lixed salt of nitre, with which the
acid spirit is combined, is very alien to the nature of
flame, and remains to a large extent at the bottom of
the crucible after the nitre has been deflagrated in it.
And, indeed, I do not know anything in nature
approaching nearer to rire than the red spirit of nitre
which passes into the receiver in the course of distilla-
tion,with a ruddy colour, but the ruddiness of nitrous
spirit, rivalling flame, seems to be due to the igneo·
aerial particles of the spirit, which are agitated with
an almost fiery movement. It is corroborative of this
view that the spirit oi nitre is extremely corrosive,
destructive, and caustic, and possesses a very dame-like
nature. And, indeed, it is probable that the form of
flame depends largely, if not exclusively, upon nitro·
aerial particles such as are contained in the spirit of
nitre, as will be shown below. .

One will readily object here that the acid spirit of
nitre is by no means combustible, for it will not, like
sulphureous matter, blaze ir thrown into the fire, but,
on the contrary, it will put the fire out. Ι reply that
the igneo-aerial particles existing in the spirit of nitre
are in a humid condition, and that they are prevented
from beginning a frery movement on account of being
covered over with particles of aeid fluid, as we have
already intimated. And, indeed, humidity is a very
