On Sal Nitrum and Nino-Ae'rr'al Spirit 15

great hindrance to fire, since it is exceedingly well
adapted for extinguishing fiery particles. But although
the spirit ol nitre will not deflagrate if put into a
dame, yet if it is poured upon salt of tartar, nitre will
be generated from the combination, and if this be
thrown into the lire it will immediately produce fiame.
But we must suppose that the flame ol this deflagrat-
ing nitre is caused by the igneo-aerial particles os the
nitrous spirit being thrown into agitation. For the
salt of tartar of which the rest of the nitre is com-
posed seems to be very alien to the nature of fleme,
as we have shown above. But the reason why the Ι
ἱςῃεο-αὲτίε] particles of nitrous spirit are well adapted,
when combined with fixed salt, for producing fleme,
seems to be this, that when the spirit ol nitre unites
with fixed salt to form nitre, its humidity being lost,
it changes into a dry and rigid substance; so that as

its igneo-aerial particles exist now in a dry condition,
there is no obstacle to their commencing a fiery
motion.

Further, nitro-aerial particles must, 'it appears, il
they are to take the form of dame, enter into close
combination with a fixed salt, or with something else
to take the place of the fixed salt ; so that they may

be torn violently and with elastic force from their
partner and thrown into a state of the most rapid
motion, as l shall endeavour to show below.
