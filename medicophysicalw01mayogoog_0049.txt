CHAPTER III

OF THE NATURE OF Nlrlro-AE‘RJAL ΛΝΒ IGNEOUS
SPIRIT

FRolr what has been already said, it is, I think, to
some extent certain what the nature of the nitro-acria}
and fiery spirit is. For since the aerial and igneous

part ol nitre, or what is the same thing, nitro-aerial
spirit, exists in the aeid spirit ol nitre and constitutes
its more active part, it follows that the nitro-aerial
and fiery spirit is of a nitro-saline nature, and has the
character rather olan aeid, than ola fixed, salt. And,
assuredly, the effects of fire seem to agree well with an
extremely subtle- and highly corrosive salt, as will be
shown immediately. It must, however, be remarked
that this igneous salt is in no way hostile to fixed
saltS, but, on the contrary, rather intensifies their
· power than diminishes it as aoid liquids do. For
fixed salts when heated in the fire become more acrid
and caustic in their nature. Certainly the aeid spirit
of nitre seems to be opposed to fixed salts ¹only as
regards its terrestrial and humid part, but not as to
its dry and fiery part. Nay, there is not so much
contrariety, I think, as is commonly supposed
between fixed salt and any aeid, as will be more
fully expounded below.

But let us consider in the next place the part which
nitro-aerial spirit, or what is the same thing, the
aerial part of nitre, plays in producing fire. On this
point my opinion is that the form ‹y‘stame z's chiefly
due to the narro-atram spirit set in metron. F orI do not
