On Sal [Vitrum and littra-Amal spirit 17

think we ought to agree with recent philosophers,
who believe that fire can be produced by the subtle
particles of any kind of matter if they are thrown into
violent agitation. In fact, while the Peripatetics
formerly assigned a distinct quality for almost every
natu-ral operation and multiplied entia unnecessarily,
the Neoterics on the other hand maintain that all
natural effects result from the same matter, its form
and its state of motion or of rest alone being changed,
and that consequently any thing whatever may be
obtained from any thing. But in truth this new
philosophy seems to depart too lar from the doctrine
of the ancients, and-I have thought it better to take
au intermediate path. lt would certainly be a reason-
able supposition that certain particles os matter which
are unlike in no other respect than in the form and
extremely solid aud compact contexture of their parts,
differ so much that by no natural power can they be
changed one into another, and that the Elementr con-
sist of primary, and in this way peculiar, particles.
Hence, Ι conceive that fire can be produced only by
particles of a certain kind, and this is obvious from
the very fact that it cannot be kindled without nitro-
aerial particles,

As regards the sulphureous particles which are
also indispensable for the productiori of fite, the
necessity for them seems to arise merely from this
that they are naturally fit to throw nitro-aerial
particles into a state of rapid and fiery commotion.
And I think it is not impossible that fire may be pro-
duced without the presence of sulphureous particles.
The fire from the solar rays when condensed by a
burning-glass, and the other celestial lires appear to
be of this sort. For although sulphureous particles

. are absolutely necessary for kindliug the kitchen fire,
