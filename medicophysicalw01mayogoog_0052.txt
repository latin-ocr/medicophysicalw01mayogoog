agile, they seem to be much better suited for execut-
ing a swift and fiery movenrent than the crasser and
very solt sulphureous particles.

But the reason for the notion that it is the sul·
phureous rather than the nitro-aerial particles which
take fire is, that the grosser sulphureous nutriment of
fire is always in view, while th'e nitro-aerial particles
are so fine and subtle that they quite escape observa·
tion, and yet it is certain that nitro-aerial particles are
not less necessary than sulphureous particles lor the
production of fire.

The following experiment confirms what hasbeen
said, viz.‚ ir nitre be put into a hot crucible it will
soon liquely but will not take fire, although oil will
immediately burn if thrown into the crucible. The
inference from this is that the fiery particles which
penetrate the glowing crucible are not of a sul-
phureous nature, for otherwise the nitre would be
kindled by the fiery particles mixed with it, for
sulphur particles when mixed with melted nitre
immediately ignite it. But the proof that the igneous
particles collected in the heated crucible are of a
nitro-saline nature is this, that any sulphureous matter
cast into the said crucible is ignited by those particles;
but sulphureous particles are not thrown into a state
of extremely rapid and fiery motion without the aid
of nitro-aerial particles.

We remark further that sulphureous particles a‘re of
so crass a nature that we can scarcely imagine, however
heated they may be and however minutely divided‚
that they will become so subtle and nimble as to be
able to penetrate, like fiery particles, metals, glans,
and such like very solid things, and this seems to be
confirmed by the following experiment. For let a
polished metal plate be kept for some time in the
