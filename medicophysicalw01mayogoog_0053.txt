flame ol a candle so that the igneous particles deeply
penetrating the said plate make it hot. But that the
igneous particles entering the plate are the nitro-
aerial particles of fire and not·.sulphureous is evi·
dent from this, that the sulphureous particles adhere
to the outer surlace of the plate in the form of soot
and do not at all penetrate the plate. And yet we
cannot doubt but that the sulphureous particles adher-
ing to the plate were on fire, as far as their nature
allows. For it must be supposed that the sulphureous
particles which ascend from the wick into the flame are
on fire from their first entrance into the dame, since
the flame could not be produced without the burning of
sulphureous particles. Nay, the black colour of these
particles indicates a burning of some sort. But this
will be made¹ clearer by what will be said below.
Fina11y‚ the nitro-aerial particles in the flama pro.
duced by colar rays collected by a burning-glass are
particularly¹ bright. This celestial flanre appears to
be due merely to the nitro-aerial particles of the
atrnosphcre set in fiery motion by the action and
intense impulse of light. And this we must suppose
is the reason that antimony, when calcined by the
solar beams‚ is fixed and made diaphoretic, just as
if it were changed into Bezoardicum mr'nerale by
spirit of nitre poured upon it and drawn off again
and again. Indeed, it is probable that it is the
nitro-aerial particles with which that spirit abounds,
· and in some motion of which the solar rays consist,
that fix antimony and render it diaphoretic. lt

favours this view that antimony acquires a diaphoretic
virtue, not only from the spirit of nitre and the solar
rays, but also from the flame of nitre in which nitro.
aerial 'particles are more densely collected. Nor
should it be overlooked that antimony, calcined by ⁴
