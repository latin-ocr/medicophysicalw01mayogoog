as has been ascertained by experiment. Indeed, we
can scarcely imagine any other source 101 this increase
of the antimony than the 111110οὂ11οΙ 01111 igneous
particles fixed in it during calcinations

Ι am aware that it is the common opinion that
the diaphoretic virtue 01 antimony is due to the
loss of its extraneous and combustible sulphur in its
calcination. But I am not sure that this view is
’ quite consistent with truth. For it is well known
that 11 antimony and nitre are mixed and thrown ’
11110 0 heated crucible, a very impetuous fiame will
arise from them, since the sulphur 01 the antimony
ignites the nitre mixed with it. If, however, the

· antimony has detonated (as the chemists phrase

it) with about a double quantity 01 nitre, then
nitre mixed with it will no longer produce a flame,
since the combustible sulphur of the antimony has
been entirely removed in the first detorration. And
still the antimony has not yet acquired the diapho
retic virtue. Hence, 101 its· further fixation, charcoal
or some sulphureous matter should be put from time
to time into the crucible in which the antimony,
along with the nitre last added 10 it, has been lused,
so that the nitre may ignite and the antimony be
fixed by its longenduring flame. Clearly, then, the
fixation 01 antimony appears to be caused, not so
much by the removal 01 115 extraneous sulphur, as
by the fixation in it 01 the nitroaerial particles in
which the flame 01 111110 abounds.

The reason why an addition 01 101101 10 111110
contributes greatly to the fixation 01 antimony is
obvious from what has been said. Fur Ι think it
must be attributed to the tartar being imbued with
such sulphur as is suitable for gradually and thoroughly
