burning the uitre. For tartar mixed with nitre effects
its calcination in the best way, as has been shown
above. And hence it is that antimony kept in the
flame of nitro, kindled by the sulphur of tartar and
long burning, is fixed by the nitro-aerial particles of
the nitre and becomes diaphoretic. Nor is it probable
that salt oi tartar contributes anything to the fixation
of antimony, For a fixed salt such as that of tartar
is quite unsuitable for exalting the emetic property
of antimony. Otherwise salt of tartar, but not tartar
itself, would have to be used for the calcination of
antimony. We remark, lastly, with respect to the
fixation of antimony, that it appears advisable to
begin its calcination in the first instance with nitre
alone, so that the nitre may kindle and remove the
impure sulphur of the antimony, and then to mix
tartar with the nitre‚ that the remainder of the
nitre, now that the sulphur of the antimony has
been removed, may be burned by the sulphur of the
tartar, and the fixation of the antimony completed.
By this hypothesis of ours, it is not difficult to
explain why fires that burn with a bright flame
purify the air from pestilential miasma‚ and are
consequently so beneficial in contagious diseases.
For no doubt the nitro-aerial particles which are
inhaled by animals in respiration (as will be shown
below) approach from all sides for the production
oi the dame, and are hurried along in it with a
motion of the greatest velocity. And the result is
that these particles are purged by the motion and
the fire from their poisonous taint. But the subject

of fire will be treated more fully in Chapter Vll.
