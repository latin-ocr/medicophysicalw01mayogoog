On Sal Nitrum and Jl'r'tro-A'e'rzizl Spirit 23

CHAPTER IV

OF THE SOURCE OF ΑΕΗ) LIQUIDS: ALSO OF THE
TERRESTRIAL PART OF THE SPIRIT OF NITRE

THnT the spirit of nitre is a compound, and that it
is derived partly from the air and partly from the
earth, has been shown above. We have already
treated of its aerial part; so that its terrestrial and
aeid part remains for discussion.

It is extremely difficult to understand how the
spirit ol nitre originates in the earth. For earth
appears to possess the nature of a hired, rather than
of an aeid, salt. And yet it is undoubtedly true
that if exposed to the air it will, after some lapse
of time, be impregnated with nitre. But it has
been shown above that the acid salt os which the
nitre in part consists originates in the earth. But
that it may be understood how the acid spirit of nitre
is generated in the carth, let me be allowed to pre-
fix some observations regarding the spirit of sulphur
and other acid liquids, because there exists among
all acid spirits a very great likeness and affinity.

Hitherto the opinion has prevailed that an acid
salt ol a vitriolic nature lies concealed in the struc-
ture ol sulphur, and that from this, exhaling in the
deflagration ol sulphur and collected in a superim-
posed glass bell-jar, the acid spirit of sulphur is
composed. But it seems scarcely probable that a
spirit so corrosive should reside in common sulphur,
which has a sweetish and by no means aeid
taste. Nay, sulphur seems to have rather the
