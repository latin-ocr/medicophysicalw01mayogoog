nature of an alkaline than of an aeid salt, as is
proved by the fact that common sulphur will enter
very readily into combination with the fixed salts
allied to it. For it must not be said here, that the
combination ol fixed salts with sulphur arises from
the secret presence of an aeid salt in the sulphur
with which the fixed salts seek a union. For if
such were the case, effervescence and heat would
be produced by the union of the sulphur and the
lixed salt, as happens in an encounter between .
opposite salts. Ι Moreover, when contending salts
are mixed together, they destroy each other and
are changed into a tertritm quid which is altogether
different from what existed before. But, in fact,
fixed salt and sulphur if melted at a low temperature
unite without any effervescence whatever3 and neither
of thern is destroyed. On the contrary, their powers
are mutually increased, as if they had united in a
friendly league.

Wherefore since it is improbable that so aeid a spirit
is contained in the mass of sulphur and is not elicited

1 unless the sulphur is burned, why should we not sup-

pose that the spirit is produced, by the burning of
the sulphur, in the following way? For I suppose
that common sulphur contains in addition to its sul-
phureous particles pure and simple, a salt of a fixed
or rather metallic nature in the closest union with its
sulphureous particles, which saline part sometimes
crystallises when sulphur is dissolved by the spirit of
turpentine.

Further, it should be noted that the flame of kindled
sulphur, as indeed flame of every kind, consists in this
that the sulphureous particles of the deflagrating
substance and the nitro-aerial particles mutually
excite themselves to a very rapid motion, as we have
