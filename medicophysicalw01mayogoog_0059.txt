and almost harmless. For if a finger or anything
combustible is thrust into the blue flanre of sulphur,
but not into the sulphur mass, it will not be burned
as by other fires, but will remain for some time
uninjured. To this we add further that the flame
of sulphur does not expand like other flames but
bursts forth from timeto time and seems as it were
to effervesce. From this it is to be inferred that
there is a third substance mixed with it on which the
fiery particles act. And that these particles, ol a saline
or metallic nature, mixed with the flame of the sulphur
and sharpened by the rubbing oi the nitro-aerial
particles and brought at last to a fluid state, constitute
the aeid aud corrosive spirit of sulphur, we take to be
at least a probable conjecture; ior otherwise I have no ·
notion how the aeid spirit is produced, for it is improb·
able that it exists in the structure ol the sulphur
before its combustion, as has been shown above.

To this we further add that the oil of vitriol expelled
aiter several days’ distillation seems to be produced
in nearly the same way. For it is certain from
experience that if the distillation of vitriol is con·
tinued with the strongest fire for ten or even more
days, aeid spirit will still all the while pass into the
receiver. But it is scarcely to be believed that any
aeid spirit is so fixed and ponderous as to be ableto
remain so long in the hottest fire. We must rather ,
suppose that nitro-a'e'rial particles of the lire, in the
course of the long continued distillation oi the vitriol,
encounter the metallic sulphur of the colcothar and
effervesce-·the result being that the saline particles-

oi that sulphur which are placed among the mutually
rubbing fiery particles are pouuded and comminuted
so as at last to be sharpened and brought into a fluid
state. And these at last carried up by the force of
