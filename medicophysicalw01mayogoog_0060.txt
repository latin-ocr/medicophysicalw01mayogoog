On Sal Nz'trum and ertro-Aiirr'al Spin't 27

the fire compose the oil of vitriol very much in the
same way as we showed above that the spirit of
sulphur is produced when sulphur is burned. And·
indeed itis probable that the distillation of vitriol
will go on as long as any of the saline particles of the
colcothar remam, these being brought into the fluid
state under the action of heat i'n the manner afore-
said.

Further, Ι do not know but that aeid spirits distilled
from heavy woods, such as' Guaiacum wood and the
like, are formed in a similar way by the action of fire
during distillation. Indeed‚ Guaiacum wood before
distillation does not seem to be endowed withan acid
but rather with a fixed salt. For its powder or decoc-
tion effervesces when spirit of vitriol (but not when
fixed salt) is poured on it. It corroborates this view
that the saline particles of that wood are in close
combination with the sulphureous particles, as will
be shown below, whence it is that the nitro-aerial.
particles of the lire, encountering the sulphureous
particles of the wood in the course of distillation‚ rub
the saline particles and bring them into a fluid state
in the manner aforesaid. We observe also in passing
that acid spirits distilled from sugar and honey appear
to be produced in a not very dissimilar way by the
action of the nitro-aerial spirit of lire. For such
plants as have no aeid taste and yet yield an aeid
spirit on distillation are composed of sulphureous in
intimate union with saline particles, and are therefore
suited for yielding an aeid liquid in the manner
aforesaid.

As the nitro-aerial spirit of fire, encountering saline-
sulphureous particles with very brisk motion and
fiery effervescence‚ rubs down in a moment and
reduces to a fluid state the saline particles which are
