closely involved with the sulphureous‚ so the same
nitro-aerial spirit effervescing in a slower motion
with saline-sulphureous particles, changes the saline
particles into an aeid liquor only after some time has
elapsed. And an example of this is to be sought in
vitriol when calcined to the entire removal of the
aeid spirit. For if that vitriol has been exposed for
sometime to moist air it will be impregnated anew
with aeid spirit. Indeed, nitro-aerial spirit encounters
,the metallic sulphur of coleothar in a gentle manner
and effervesees with it in an obscure way, whence it
is that the saline or metallic particles of the sulphur
are brought in the manner aforesaid to a state of
fluidity. Certainly we can scarcely imagine any
other mode for the formation of the vitriolic spirit
in coleothar, for it does not arise in the coleothar
immediately after distillation, and we cannot suppose
(as has been elsewhere shown) that it is entirely de-
rived from the air.

Further‚ the aeid spirit of which vitriols are
composed seems obviously to be produced in the same
way. For vitriols are produced from the stone or
rather the saline-sulphureous earth usually called
Marchasite, and from it on the application of fire
the flowers of common sulphur are elieited in con-
siderable abundanee. But after this earth has been
exposed for some time to the air and wet weather and
then (as its nature is) has fermented spontaneously, it
will be found to be riehly impregnated with vitriol,

No doubt the nitro-aerial spirit, effervescing with the
metallic sulphur of these Marchasites, converts their
more fixed part into an aeid liquid which, direetly it “
is produced, attacks the metallic particles of the said
stone and draws them out and at last coalesces with
them to form vitriol.
