On Sal Nitrum and Mtte-Airial spirit 31

in another place that fertile earth is nothing but
sulphur and fixed salt both immature, in a state of
the closest combination, and indeed a dark purple
clod of earth appears not very unlike colcothar, except
thatin the latter sulphur is combined with a metallic
salt but in the former with fixed salt. As then the
nitro-aerial spirit effervescing in a fiery motion with
the particles of common sulphur, or again encounter-
ing with more gentle beat the saline-sulphureous
particles of colcothar, sharpens more quickly or more
slowly their saline-metallic particles and brings them
to a fluid condition ; so also the same nitro-aeria] spirit,
descending in virtue of its most penetrating nature
into the depths of the earth, there attacks the ter·.
restrial sulphur and fermenting with it in an obscure
motion rubs, attenuates, and sharpens the saline
particles which are firmly clasped in its bosom, so
that they at last became flexile, liquid, and in the
highest degree acrid. The saline particles of the
earth when made fluid in this manner become a
suitable abode in which nitro-aerial particles may be
hidden and detained. And in my opinion the spirit
of nitre, of the sort obtained by distillation, is com·
posed of these two firmly united.

And so at last Ι have endeavoured to show that
all aeid salts are produced from saline particles
brought to a state of fluidity or fusion by means of
nitro-aerial spirit, and also how this is done. With
respect to the difference of aeid liquids—this must be
supposed to result from diversity of the salts out of
which they are formed, as also from this, that
the fixed salts are rubbed and sharpened now in
a greater and now in a less degree by the nitro·
adrial spirit. And yet there is a great affinity and
likeness among all acid salts, and in thern all, as in
