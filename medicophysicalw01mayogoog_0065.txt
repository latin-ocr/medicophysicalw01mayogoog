an appropriate medium, nitreaerial and igneous
particles reside, as will be shown below.

The particles of nitrous spirit generated in the earth
in the manner aforesaid, as soon as they are produced,
approach the seeds of the fixed salts which, as has
been elsewhere shown, are hidden in the bosom of the
earth, and solicit and call them forth into conjugal
union as a suitable consort and of their own kin;
and, lastly, from them, combined in the closest alliance,
sal nitrum is produced, much as in colcothar or
vitriolic earth, other saline particles that have been
brought to a fluid condition by nitro-aerial spirit,
meeting other saline particles of a nature akin to
their own, coalesce to form vitriol as we have indicated
above.

It follows from what has been said that there is no
such great repugnance between fixed and acid salts
as is commonly supposed. That they indeed boil up,
when mixed together, with remarkable violence should
not be imputed to any eumity between thern but
rather to a sort of conjugal affection. These salts, in
fact, grind each other in order that they, being divided
to the utmost extent possible, may be united in a
closer bond.

From what has been said the reason is clear why
nitrous but not purely saline salts are extracted by
lixiviation from the earth, for particles of nitrous
spirit generated in the earth take into union with
them and render nitrous all the fixed salt which has
attained to perfect maturity. And, indeed, it is prob·
able that the seeds of the fixed salts existing in the
bosorn of the earth cannot be lixiviated and extracted
without the aid of nitrous spirit.

That nitre is generated in the earth in the manner
aforesaid may be inferred also from the fact that it is
