Water seems to bea suitable vehicle for nitro-aerial
spirit and sulphur, and together with terra damnata
contributes to the building up of the frame of things
in due strength and consistency.

Thus far of the elements viewed in themselves ς we
have next to consider thern in regard to how far they

act on each other and mutually enter into various
combinations. Hence proceed the internal move·
ments of things and their rise and destruction.
First then, in the birth of plants, the nitro-aerial
spirit or Mercury when set in motion by the impulse
of solar rays descends in virtue of its very penetrating
nature into the depths of the earth and attacks there
its most bitter enemy terrestrial sulphur, firmly
united with fixed salt and nearly hidden and buried
in its embrace; and by its very frequent vibrations
lashes and wears it. The sulphur thus aroused and
to some extent liberated from its terrestrial yolre by
the frequent blows of the nitro-aerial particles begins
a contest with its nitro-aerial foe, and from their
mutual disturbance a rather notable effervescence is
excited in the bosom of the earth, as we have indi·
cated above. Meanwhile the particles ol fixed salt
held in the embrace of the sulphur are so worn by
numerous strokes of the nitro-aerial spirit that they
are brought at last into a fluid condition in the way
described above. And by these, when liquefied, any
fixed salt still adhering to the terrestrial sulphur is
lixiviated (as was shown above). And so at last the
nitro-aerial Mercury, having according to his furtive
nature secretly entered the territory of his enemy
sulphur and robbed him of his saline consort, wedded
