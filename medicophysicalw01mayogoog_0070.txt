On Sal Nitrum and Nitro-Aiirial spirit 37

embrace. For it has been shown above that nitro·
adrial spirit is detained as in a suitable hospice in
fixed salt which has passed into the fluid state. But
when held in the embrace oi a salt and coalescing
with it, which is partly aeid partly saline, to form
nitre, it exists in a condition of the greatest fixity.
But meanwhile the terrestrial sulphur which, not
so long ago, wrapped in wedlock with fixed salt, was
fixed indeed, now, the saline yoke thrown off by help
of the nitro-aerial spirit, attains a condition of vola-
tility and gets the mastery, the nitroaerial spirit

being depressed. And in this way, in fine, extremely
volatile and inflammable sulphureous particles (such
as the oils which are obtained by distillation from
plants) are very likely produced from the rude mass
of the earth, which seems to behave like a caput
mortuum. For the volatilisation of sulphur consists

in its being liberated from a union with fixed salt.
And it is therefore clear that the fixation of sulphur
arises from its intimate union with a fixed salt. For
is sulphureous oils are combined with fixed salt, as is
the case in soap, they lose their inflammability alto-
gether. For soap, which is partly composed of oil,
will not blaze if thrown into the fire.

When in this way nitro-aerial spirit, effervescing
obscurely with terrestrial matter, raises its sulphureous
part to the requisite volatility and coalesces also with
its saline part to form nitre, the elements of natural
things are brought into the condition required for
the production of plants. For all plants seem to be
composed of terrestrial sulphur in a sufficiently volatile
and inflammable condition, and of nitro-aerial spirit
held in the embrace of salt and subdued,‘that is to say
of nitrous salt, as will be shown presently.

It serves as a proof of the origin of vegetables in
