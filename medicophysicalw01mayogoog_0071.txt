this way that at the time when vegetables chiefly
spring from the earth, the nitro-a‘e'rial spirit ferments
most actively with terrestrial matter, and sal nitrum
is chiefly produced in the earth: in fact experience
shows that nitre (which we suppose to be formed by
nitro-airial spirit effervescing with the saline-sulphu-
reous particles of the earth) is produced in the earth
in greater abundance in the beginning of spring than
in the other seasons of the year. ln winter, indeed,
nitro-ae'rial particles and terrestrial sulphur are com-
pressed by frost and are lettered as it were and
hindered almost from moving at all. But at the be·
ginning of spring nitro-aerial spirit is set in motion by
the greater heat ol the sun, and the structure of the
earth is laid open now that the ice has melted. And
then the nitro-aerial spirit set in motion descends deep
into the earth, and meeting there with its saline-sul-
phureous particles, minutely broken, gives rise to an
intense enough effervescence, with the result that
nitre is generated in abundance, and plants grow up
luxuriantly.

From what has been said we can see why animal
- excreta, salts of lye and also quicklime, and similar
substances imbued with fixed salts fertilise the soil.
Indeed the saline-sulphureous excreta of animah, as
also fixed salts in union with terrestrial sulphur, are
specially adapted for effervescing with nitro-aerial
spirit, and they also supply appropriate material for
the production of nitre and consequently contribute
not a little to the productiori ol plants.

Thus then the so much talked of fermentation by
which the numerous family of plants is produced from
the bosom of the earth, appears to be nothing else
but the internal motion ol nitro-aerial particles when
they meet with the sulphur and salt ol the earth, in
