On Sal Nitrum and rutro-Aera! spirit 39

virtue of which terrestrial nitre is produced and the
sulphur brought to a suitable volatility.

lt follows from what has been said that the salts of
which plants are composed are to sonre extent nitrous
and not purely saline, as we intimated above. For all
vegetable salts are derived either from the air or from
the earth. As regards the air it is by no means to be
supposed that an alkaline and fixed salt resides in it ;
nor is the earth impregnated with a purely saline salt,
for only nitrous salts can be extracted from it by lixi-
viation. And hence we may conclude that the salts
of plants are nitrous and not purely saline. Hence
in soil on which plants grow abundantly no nitrous·
salt is ‚to be found, the reason being that all the nitre '
of the soil is sucked out by the plants. But when
plants are calcined to ashes, the aeid spirit of the
nitre of which they are composed goes off as vapours,
while the other clement of the nitre-to wit, the
alkaline salt—is left in the ashes. And hence it is
that plants yield a greater quantity of fixed salt
when burned fresh and with the least possible flame;
but this does not result as some suppose because the
alkaline salt goes off as vapours when the plants
are slightly dried, for it has an exceedingly fixed
nature and remains undiminished and intact in the
hottest fire. But when plants containing much sul-
phur are dried and then burned in a bright flame,
the sulphureous parts, burning with a fiercer flanre‚
kindle the nitrous salt, and carry the whole ol it
away with them as vapours, very much as when
gunpowder is ignited. If, however, green herbs are
calcined with the flame kept down, their volatile
sulphur, together with the original moisture, passes
into smoke and goes away, while the nitrous salt
remains behind; but ir calcined in a hotter fire, the
