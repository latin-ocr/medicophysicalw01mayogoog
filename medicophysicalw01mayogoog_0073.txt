spirit 01 nitre is expelled as by distillation, the alkaline
salt being left with the terra damnata in the ashes3
and in proportion to the violence with which the
calcination is effected, in that proportion are the salts
alkalised when the nitrous spirit is expelled. Hence
we may gether that it is not advisable violently to
calcine diuretic salts (so named from promoting
urine), for, by doing so, those salts are deprived 01
their nitrous and diuretic spirit. And hence it is
that the lye, say 01 1110 ashes 01 Gem'sta, is more
efficacious in dropsy than its fixed salt thoroughly
alkalised by violent calcination.

The nitrous spirit 01 plants seems to be clearly
present in a lire 01 burning charcoal, for the smoke
from that fire assails the nostrils when brought near
to it, very much in the same way as the vapour that
proceeds from the spirit 01 nitre. And indeed it is
likely that the nitrous spirit which exhales from
burning charcoal in the form 01 smoke, is the reason
for that smoke being so acrid‚ and for its sometimes
causing suffocation.

And further the nitrous spirit 01 plants 1000110515
115011 strikingly in their fermenting juices‚ when these
have been kept for some time in a glass vessel care-
fully closed. For when these liquids are drunk the
nitrous particles irritate the nervous parts 01 1110
throat with a quite striking pungency and bring on
an almost convulsive choking. So that, when liquids
0f this sort are drunk, they are commonly and not

improperly said to cut. Moreover, the nitrous par-
ticles m which these liquids abound seem to be the
cause of their being so cold. For nitre mixed with
liquids makes them very cold‚ and almost freezes
them, as will be shown more fully elsewhere·

In some plants the oily parts are so heavy and so
