On Sal lllitrum and Miro-Ae'n'al spirit 41

closely united with nitrous salt that they a're not
separated from each other by calcinati0n; but the

burning sulphureous particles carry the nitrous par-
ticles away with them as vapours. And hence it is
that plauts of this sort yield only a small quantity
ol fixed salt, as is the case with resinous woods, such
as Lagnum sanctum and the like. .

Nor should it be overlooked that the nitre innate
in plants contributes not a little to their burning, and
that those which abound the most in nitrous par·
ticles take fire at once, even when they are green
and full of moisture. Among these the ash is espe-
cially remarkable, for be it ever so green it yet burns
with a bright flame. But, indeed, its richness iu nitre
may be inlerred from the lact that while burning
it gives out, from time to time, cracks like kindled
nitre.

Thus far, we have considered the fermentation
tending to the productiori of plants. We have still
to inquire shortly as to the internal motion by which
plants rush to their destruction. ,

In regard to this, it is our opinion that the fer-
mentation which tends to the destruction of plauts is
also caused by the mutual agitation of the nitro-aerial
and saline-sulphureous particles—with this distinction,
however, that in the origin of vegetables, nitro-aerial
spirit, when put in vigorous movement, attacks sul-
phur existing in a fixed state, and when the sulphur
has been brought to volatility, the nitro-aerial spirit
is fixed, imprisoned iu saline bonds, as has been shown
above. But, on the other hand, in the destruction
*ol things, the internal movement is for the most part
set up by the sulphur being too highly exalted. In
fact, the sulphureous particles in a state of too vigorous
movement attack the nitro-aerial spirit when lying
