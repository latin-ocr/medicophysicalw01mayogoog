asleep iu the bosom of the fixed salt, and mindsul
as it were of former wrongs, thrust it forth from its
saline shelter and set it in motion; but the nitro·
ae'rial spirit, when violently torn hom its saline
partner, throws everything into disorder by its im·
petuous motion and loosens the union of the com·
pound. But in order that what has been said may
be better understood, let us consider in how many
ways things rush to their destruction, lor in all
these we shall find that internal movement is caused
by sulphureous particles and nitro-aerini spirit whether
the latter is derived from without or not.

In the first place, the mode in which the structure
oi things is most speedily dissolved is Fire. But this
is nothing else than an erceedingly impetuous fer-
mentation of nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles in
mutual agitation, as has been shown above. Thus,
in combustion, sulphureous particles, moving with
extreme velocity, throw into a most violent aud
hery motion the nitroaerial particles which exist
m astate of fixation. This is evident when nitre is
burned‚ for in its burning, nitro-aerial particles which
were previously fixed and inert in the embrace of
the fixed salt, are thrown into fiery motion by the
ogcncy of the sulphureous particles. And indeed
rt rs probable that even the nitro-aerial particles of
the air are in a fixed state previous to their being
roused into fiery motion, as 1 shall endeavour to
show elsewhere.

”As the destructive power of fire is due to nitro-
aerral penicles, so also every internal movement
