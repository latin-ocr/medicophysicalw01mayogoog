excited, and this must be supposed to result from
the motion of nitro-adrial particles, as will be shown
immediately. How great moreover is the reseru-
blance and affinity between lire and all other fer-
rnentations will appear from what follows.

With regard to fire, it is to be noted that for the
burning of things, it is necessary that nitro-adrial
particles should either be already in the burning
substance or be supplied from the air. Gunpowder
burns very readily on account of the nitro-aerial
particles it contains; plants burn partly from the

nitro-adrial particles they contain, and partly from ,

such as come from the air; but sulphureous matter,
pure and simple, can only be ignited by nitro-aerial
particles supplied by the air.

And, just as for the production ol lire, so also lor
exciting fermentations in plants‚ both sulphureous
and nitro-adrial particles must either exist in the
things to be fermented or be supplied from without.
The juice expressed from plants‚ such as the must
ol wine or of apples and the like, effervesces on
account of the nitro-adrial and sulphureous particles
which it contains. For we have shown above that
nitrous salts and therefore also nitro-adrial particles
are contained in most plants‚ though, at the same
time, the nitro-adrial spirit supplied by the air con-
tributes much to the fermentation of these liquids,
for very warm weather intensifies the action in no
small degree. Further, that the fermentation of the
aforesaid liquids, as also of all things whatsoever, is
due to the mutual agitation of nitro-adrial and
saline·sulphureous particles, is evident from the fact
that liquids ol this kind, and indeed nearly every
thing, become sour in fermenting3 for it has been
shown above that acidity is caused by the action of
