On Sal Nitrum aud M'tro-A'e'rial Spirit 45

sulphur and salt, fixed or volatile, are particularly
adapted for producing fermentation. Oi this kind
are yolk of egg and all sorts of gall of animals, as
also soap-all of which when mixed with any farina-
ceous mass make it swell and ferment in cooking.
But the fermentative nature of the things named
seems to be due to this, that in cooking, the nitro-aerial
particles of the fire meet their saline-sulphureous par·
ticles and effervesce with them.

Ι add further, that the glow or warmth which
arises in nearly everything when fermenting, appears
to be caused by nitro-aerial spirit, as has been already
indicated. For I think it is clear, from what has been
said elsewhere, that a most intense and fiery heat
proceeds from nitro-aerial particles when thrown into
very rapid motion. And indeed we must suppose
that heat of every kind depends upon the same
particles when briskly agitated, for heat and fire
must be supposed to result from the agitation with
different degrees of motion of the same kind of
particles. For in glowing substances of all sorts the
presence of nitro-aerial particles is shown by suffi-
ciently clear signs.

As to the heat resulting from lire and from the
fermentation of things, it has now been shown that
it is caused by the motion of nitro-adrial particles.
As to the heat ol antagonistic salts when mixed
together, we must imagine that it too is caused by ’
nitro-aerial spirit. For it ¹has already been shown
that aeid and corrosive liquids are produced by the
action of nitro-aerial particles, and that nitro-adrial
spirit resides in them as in a fitting subject ; although
Ι shall endeavour to show below that the heat pro-
duced by the fermentation of contrary salts depends
also upon nitro-aerial particles supplied by the air.
