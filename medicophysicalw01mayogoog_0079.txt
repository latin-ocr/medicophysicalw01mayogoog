Further, with respect to the heat- which arises in
solid bodies when rubbed together, it is probably
due lo nitro-aerial particles residing in those bodies
and thrown into motion by vehement rubbing; for
the more solid kinds of wood appear to be rich in
nitrous particles as, has been shown above. Nay,
that solidity and even rigidity are caused by nitro-
aerial particles I shall endeavour to show below.
Lastly, with respect to blood, and quicklime, and
other things of the same kind, it will be established
below that their heat is produced by nitro-aerial
spirit.

Lastly, we remark with regard to fermentation in
general that nitro-aerial spirit will not ferment with
sulphur unless the sulphur is to some extent fixed.

For liquids which contain sulphureous particles ·

highly exalted, such as spirit of wine, never effer-
vesce even though exposed to the warmest air, while
juice expressed from grapes and new ale (in which
the sulphureous particles have not yet attained to
vigour and inflammability) ferment of themselves.
And indee'd it is the saline particles in union with
the sulphureous which seem to be the cause of
everything becoming aeid in fermentation as we
have indicated above. For the saline particles which
were previously wrapped up in the sulphureous
particles, are afterwards by fermentation set free
from their fellowship, and besides brought into a
fluid condition as described above.

But although nitro-aerial spirit does not attack
highly exalted sulphureous particles, yet sulphureous
particles, when in the greatest vigour and agitation,
attack nitroairial spirit and throw it into a very
swift and fiery motion. For, as it is necessary that
sulphur should beto some extent in a state of fixation
