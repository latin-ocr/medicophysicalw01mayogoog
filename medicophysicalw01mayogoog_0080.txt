iu order to produce in substances the more sluggish
movement of fermentation, s0‚ on the other hand,
for au effervescence exceedingly intense and igneous,
it appears to be necessary that nitro-aerini spirit
should exist in a somewhat fixed condition, but the
sulphureous particles in a state of vigour and
motion, as we have indicated above.

Tuus far we have treated of uitro-aeria! spirit in its
state of motion and vigour; it remains to contemplate
it in a state of rest. As the nitro-aerial particles in
a state of motion are the cause of nearly all natural
movements-so, on the other hand, they are the
cause, I think, of rigidity and the power of resil-
ienee, when quiescent and securely fixed in the pores
oi bodies.

For in order that glass or iron and the like may
become rigid and acquire the power of resilienee
they must be made to glow in a very hot fite, and
then be quickly cooled by being plunged at once
into cold water, that so the nitro-adrial particles
conveyed by the fire to the said substances may
be obstructed in their movement by encountering
cold, and secured more firmly in the structure of
these substances. For the same nitro-adrial par-
