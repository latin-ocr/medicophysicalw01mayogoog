ticles which, when whirled round and hot, separated,
from each other the particles ol these glowing sub·
stances and opened up their structure, now, when they
cease to move in consequence of encountering cold,
are fixed like wedges or very solid spikelets iu their
pores. Things are hardened by them when fixed iu
this manner, aud indeed cold seems to close the pores
of things in this way only.

But that nitro-aerial particles reside in iron made
rigid in this way, is evident from the fact, that this iron
acquires the property of giving out fire when struck
by a fliut. For we must suppose that the sparks
struck out from steel are caused by igneo-uitrous
particles ol the steel bursting forth with extreme
velocity on account oi the violence of the blow.
Indeed we perceive that the fire ol these sparks is
very like buming nitre, and that they burn very
readily though struck out from the steel in a place
where there is no air-which is certainly a clear
proof that there are nitro-aerial particles in steel. so
that to strike lire from it there is no need-as iu
other cases where fire is produced—for nitro-aerial
particles to be supplied from the air. It corrobo-
rates this view that if heated iron cools slowly, the
igneo-nitrous particles gradually extricate themselves
and escape through the open pores of the iron (for these
are not, asin the previous case, contracted by the cold) ;
so that the iren, from want of igneo-nitrous par·
ticles, becomes less rigid, and unfit to give out lire¹
when struck. And what the ingenious Dr R. Hooke
has set down in his Micrographz'a is not opposed
to this—to wit, that the sparks of steel‚ after their
extinction, are nothing but small globules or minute
vitrified bits of steel. For it must not on that account
be thought that little morsels of metal take the form
