On Sal Nitrum and Nitro-Ae'rial spirit 49

ol flame when greatly agitated by a very violent blow,
but rather that the igneo-aerial particles hidden in
Ι the pores of the iron are excited by the violence of the
blow into a really tiery motion, and that a little bit 'of
the iron is melted by thern and changed into a sort of
glass

As the rigidity of iron and· glass and similar sub-
stances arises from nitro-aerial particles imparted to
them by fire, so probably the rigidity of frozen water
is also caused by nitro-a'e'rial particles which, from
being fixed like pegs between the aqueous particles,
arrest their fluid movement and press them together.
For as in fire nitro-a'e'rial particles whirled round with
swiftest motion disturb the particles of the substances
in which they exist and break them into minute parts,
so on the contrary in the cold, they, set up as
spikeS, fasten like wedges among the particles of bodies
and cause them to become rigia as has been said
above. ,

That nitro-aerial and igneous particles in a state of
rest produce rigidity and cold may be inferred from
the case ol nitre itself in which the nitro-aerial particles
become extremely cold, and when mixed with vinous
liquids almost freeze them, and yet il they are agitated .
by sulphureous particles they become in fact fiery, as
happens in the ignition of nitre. And hence it is that
if the hand or other member when stiff with cold be
brought near the fire it is hurt as if by fire and
even destroyed, for the nitro-aerial particles which
freeze as it were the chilly part in which they are fixed‚
assume also a fiery nature when agitated by the heat
ol the fire and burn it. So that without doing violence
to language cold may properly be said to burn.

In the foregoing we must· seek for the reason why

water that hasbeen boiled freezes sooner, as some
