suppose, on being exposed to cold. For nitro-aerial
particles derived from the fire abound in boiling water,
and these when they cease to move on exposure to
cold no longer agitate the aqueous particles but fix
and freeze them. For the case here does not seem to
be very different from that of glowing iton being
plunged into cold water, for the iron, cooling rapidly,
becomes more rigid and so to say firmly frozen. And
indeed in my opinion frozen water differs from
hardened iton chiefly in this, that the branching
particles of the iron adhere firmly to each other as
though they were joined by clasping hooks‚ so that
the nitro-aerial spicules are more closely interiaced
with them.

Hence too the 'reason is obvious why soil that has
been bound fast in the ice of winter becomes more
fertile in the following spring. Doubtless the nitro-
a'e'rial particles from which when closely fixed in its
structure the freezing of the soil results, produce when
set in motion afterwards by the warmth of spring that
effervescence in the bosom of the earth to which the
generation of all-fertilising nitre and the growth of
plants are due, as is shown elsewhere.

Further‚ that water is frozen by nitro-aerial particles
fixed in it seems also to be confirmed by the fact that
when frozen it is rarified and expanded. 1 am aware
that the ingenious Descartes gives a different explana·
tion of the rarefaction of frozen water. ln fact that
eminent man supposes that the aqueous particles when
less disturbed by subtle matter cease to move and
become somewhat curved‚ from which it results that
they cannot then contract themselves into so narrow a
space as before, when the subtle matter having power
enough to bend them as it pleased was always adaptin g
their forms to the measure of the places in which they
