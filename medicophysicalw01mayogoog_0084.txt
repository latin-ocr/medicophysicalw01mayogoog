were. But in fact what should force the aqueous
particles set in motion by the subtle matter into other
situations, once they have adapted their forms to the
dimensions of the places in which they are? For
they should rather retain the same situation by ceasing
to move. For particles adapted to any space would by
no means change their position and recede from each
other with conspicuous force (as happens with lrozen
water, which breaks through the strongest glass), unless
some force were applied to those particles.

It is probable then that nitro-aerini particles enter
the pores of the water pointwise and like wedges draw
them somewhat apart from one another so that the
mass of that water-has to dilate and swell‚ the aqueous
particles meanwhile passing from a flexible to a rigid
condition owing to the nitro-aeria] particles which are
lixed in them, so that they no longer flow hither and
thither but are joined and, by cohering firmly together,
constitute a solid body.

We note here in passing that as nitro-aerial particles
arrest the movement of aqueous particles and freeze
them, so nitro-aeria} particles when secured in their
turn among aqueous particles are as it were lettered
and fixed. And this seems to be the reason why
water is specially adapted for extinguishing flame;
while yet, on the other hand, sulphureous and nitro-
a'e'rial particles mutually agitate and repel each other.
And hence it is that spirituous liquids which contain
volatile sulphur are never frozen. For if wine be¹
exposed to the cold ol winter all the spirituous and
sulphureous particles of the wine will be driven into
the mid-liquid and only the aqueous particles circu-
lating round them will be frozen. Indeed the nitro-
a'e'rial particles ward off and repel as much as possible
the sulphureous particles and surround them, when
