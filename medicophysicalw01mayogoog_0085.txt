OF THE RATIONAL CAUSE OF ElASTICITl'

So much then for the cause of rigidity. lt remains
to inquire why rigid bodies when bent spring back ol
themselves to their original shape—for in this lies the
explanation of elasticity. But to pave the way to
our view of the subject the following must he premised.

In the first place, let us consider in how many ways
rigid bodies can be beot, and what sort of change as
to their shape they undergo when bent. Suppose then
arigid body with its sides equal and parallel such as
that delineated in Plate I., Fig. 4.

In the first place, this rigid body can be bent by
elongating its convex sursace while the concave surface
remains of the same length as before inflexion, as is
shown in Plate l., Fig. 5, where let a, c, b, n, d, be the
bent rigid body whose concave surface a, c, is supposed
to be equal to the length of the rigid body before in-
flexion but whose convex surface b, n, d, is elongated
by as much as the line b, n, d, is longer than the line
a, c.

The second mode of bending a rigid body is that in
which the convex surlace is drawn inwards towards
the concave surface—all the surfaces of the rigid body
retaining meanwhile their original length as is shown
in Plate t, Fig. 5, where leta, c, -b, e, d, be the bent
rigid body whose convex surface b, e, d, we suppose,
while the rigid body is bent, to be brought just sofar
inwards as to be equal to the concave surfaee a, ε,

that is to the length of the rigid body before inflexion.
And indeed if all the sides of rigid bodies are to retain

when bent their original length, they can be bent in
