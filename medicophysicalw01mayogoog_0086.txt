no other way than by approximating their convex and
concave surfaces.

The third mode of bending a rigid body is that in
which the planes at its extremities are turned towards
each other and also elongated, while the concavo and
convex surfaces retain their original length as in Plate
1.‚ Fig. 6, in which let a, c, b, d, be the bent rigid body
whose convex surface b, d,I suppose to be equal to the
linei, i, or what is the same thing to the length of the
rigid body before it was bent. Then the planes at its
extremities a, b, and c, d, must be turned towards
each other and elongated as is clear from the figure.
For these end planes are inclined at the angle b, i, e,
and are elongated by as much as the plane b, i, is
longer than the plane e, i.

Lastly‚ a rigid body can be bent by shortening its
concave surface while its convex surface and also end
planes remain of the same length as before; as may
be seen in Plate 1.,Fig. 7, where let a, c, b, d, be the
bent rigid body whose concave side a, c, Ι suppose
before the inflexion equal to the line between the
’ extremities e, e. But now when the rigid body is bent
that surface is shortened by the difference between e, a,
and e, c. But we suppose the convex surface b, d, to
retain its original length, or what is the same thing to
be equal to the line between the extremities e, e.

But these observations regarding the various modes
of bending a rigid body will be better understood from
the following example. At the ends of a flexible rod,

let two other shorter rods also flexible be fixed perpen-
dicularly, as in Plate L, Fig. 8. Then let a string
attached to the end of one of the rods bc passed
through a hole in the end of the other, as is seen in
the same figure. Then the rod with the two small
rods and the attached string will represent the sides of
