the rigid body delineated in Fig. 4. But now il the
rod be bent so as to represent the concave surface of
the rigid body while the string represents the convex,
and the string meanwhile has been loosened at one of
its ends so that it cau be lengthened as the rod bends
so as to remain parallel to it, then the beut rod with
the string parallel to it aud the rods at its ends will
represent the rigid body beut in the first manner and
delineated iu Fig 5. ’ .

But if the string is fastened at each end so that rt
cannot be lengthened when the rod is bent‚ you will
see that the string which represents the conver surface
of ‘the rigid body passes inwards and is drawn towards
the stick or concave surface exactly like the rigid body
bent in the second manner and delineated in Plate
I., Fig· 5· ’

Further‚ if the string be hindered by any force from
being drawn inwardly when the rod is bent, then the
two little rods which represent the end planes of the
rigid body will be drawn inwards towards each other,
as is the case in a rigid body bent in the third manner
and delineated in Fig. 6. But in order that the rigid

- body may be exhibited as it is bent in the said figure,

the rods at the eud should not only be drawn towards
each other but also lengthened.

Finally‚ ir the rod be bent towards the string so as to
represent the convex side of the bent rigid body, and
the cord which now represents the concave side be
meanwhile shortened‚ but in such a way as to remain
parallel to the rod, you will have a representation of
a rigid body as it is bent in the last mode in Fig. 7.

We have next to remark with respect to rigid bodies
that their branching parts are so mutually interlaced
and so firmly compacted that the rigid bodies can
neither be lengthened nor shortened without being
