ruptured. Indeed rigid bodies seem to acquire a
nature of this kind because their pores are crammed
and wholly filled up with certain particles fixed in
them, so that the shape of their pores can by no force
be altered, for in order that anything may be elongated
by extension or shortened by compression its pores
must change to a'more oblong shape. rFor example,
let us put before our eyes a row of parts or branchlets
linked together such as is delineated in Plate1.‚Fig. 1.
If this is to be lengthened or shortened it will be
necessary for the pores of the said branchlets to become
more oblong, as is manifest in Plate 1, Figs. 2 and 3,
the first of which represents the pores of the elongated
and the second of the shortened branchlets changed in
both cases, though in a different manner, into a more
oblong shape. If these peres, however, be completely
filled with any solid particles, then in this case neither
the branchlets nor their potes could have their length
extended. And indeed it is probable that nitro-aeria]
particles are fixed like little pegs in the pores of rigid
bodies and fill them up, since it is by these being
lixed in the pores of bodies that rigidity is produced,
as was previously shown. And hence it comes about
that neither the pores of rigid bodies nor consequently
the rigid bodies themselves can be either elongated or
shortened. And from this we may infer that when
perfectly rigid bodies are bent they remain on every
side of the same length as before.

These things being assumed, it follows that the
convex surface of a perfectly rigid body will in bending
be drawn towards the concavo surface as is the case

when a rigid body is bent in the second manner. For
if it were bent in any other way some one of its
surfaces would have to be either elongated or con·
tracted, as is evident from what hasbeen said. But
