shortened-but since, as is probable, there is nothing
so perfectly rigid, we must suppose that, in the bend-
ing of such rigid bodies as we know, not only does the

convex side come nearer to the concave, but that also
the planes at the ends incline to each other in the
manner already described, also that the convex side is ·
alittle elongated, and lastly that the concave side is
just such a little shortened. For the force by which a
rigid body is bent tends to produce all these results.
For I think it is the case always that if a force seeks
to effect something and there are various ways in
which it may attain the result, while yet there is in all
of them great resistance and difficulty, the force Ι say
endeavours to perform the thing in these several ways
Hence since a rigid body can be bent, as was pre-
viously shown, either by the approximation of the
convex to the concave side, or by the elongation of the
one or the shortening of the other, or lastly by the in-
clination to each other of the end planes; and since '
there is at the same time great resistance to the
bending ol the rigid body by any of the methods (for
the matter of a rigid body is so dense and compact,
that its sides cannot without difficulty be drawn
towards each other; its sides also are so firm and solid
that they cannot be lengthened or shortened without
great pressure), hence I say the force by which one
tries to bend a rigid body has enough to do in effecting
its purpose in those several ways. Still, however,
while the rigid body is bending at the same time in all
of these ways, its matter suffers a notable compression,
especially at the middle, as is evident from what has Α
been said. It should also be remarked here that when
the force by which a rigid body is bent tends to draw
the convex surface towards the concave, it tends also
by compressing the matter of the rigid body to pro-
