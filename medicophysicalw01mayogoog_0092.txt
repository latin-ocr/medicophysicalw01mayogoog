from eto i-while the rigid body is thus bending
there is no need that the convex surlace should move
inwards, and so the matter of a rigid body thus
bent will suffer no compression. And yet the convex
suriace is diminished a half less in this case than in
the preceding.

And now we remark that in the case of a very
slender rigid body such as glass threads, whose suriaces
are much nearer each other than in the figure, the
contractiori of the concave suriace and the elongation
of the convexare extremely small. And hence it is
that the more slender rigid bodies are very easily bent ;
for if their sides, as is the case here, be but a little
lengthened or shortened their matter will scarcely be
compressed at all. On the other hand, let a, c, f, g, be
a bent rigid body twice as thick as the former. If in
bending this body, its convex surface is not to be
drawn inwards, nor its matter compressed, the elonga-
tion of the convex suriace and the shortening of the
concave must be much greater than in the previous
case. For the elongation of the convex surlace has to
be as great at each end as is the distance f, 0, and g, ο,
or at least hali that distance. For we suppose the line
between the limits o, o, to be equal to the line a, c, or
what is the same thing to the length of the rigid body
before inflexion. Now this can be easily illustrated
by means of the instrument delineated in Fig. 8. For
if the string of that instrument be placed near the rod,
so that the apparatus may represent a somewhat
slender rigid body, then if the string be lengthened out
a little, while the rod is bent, it will remain always
parallel to the rod and will not be constrained to move
inwards, and yet ii the string beata greater distance

from the rod you will see that the string, unless it be
drawn out much more while the rod is bending, will
