particles and the subtle matter existing in the interior '
cannot as ln other cases extricate themselves. Hence
it is that in glass contracted in this way the subtle
matter imprisoned among the minutest particles 01
the glass has not room as before for freely continuing
its movements. For resistance is made to the move·
ment 01 the subtle matter, from two causes ; first,
because the particles 01 the glass being at rest do not
yield to the movement 01 the subtle matter as before ;
and secondly, because the particles 01 the glass in sub-
siding under the pressure of the atmosphere are driven
into the little spaces in which the perpetually agitated
matter carries out its motion. Hence that matter
strikes the particles 01 glass which oppose its motion
and endeavours to part them from each other. Indeed
the case is very much as ifthe glass were bent almost
to breaking ; in fact it is to be observed that the
pulsatioh of the subtle matter is almost capable 01
breaking the said glasses, as is evident from the fact
that when drops 01 molten glass are dropped into
water most 01 them immediately burst asunder3 and
indeed we must suppose that all the rest just escape
being broken. ·

Wherefore when the beak 01 this kind' 01 glass is
broken, the force 01 the subtle matter, aided somewhat
by the concussion of the whole glass caused by the
fracture 01 the beak, is now able to draw the particles
01 the glass apart and to thrust them out with violence.
Ι add further that when the glass is broken in any
part, the particles 01 glass which were previously con-
fined by its extremely solid sursace, rush out by the
open door at the very moment when the effort 01 the
subtle matter begins to take effect, and by this no
small addition is made to its force. And, finally, let us

further consider that the pointed beak 01 the glass
