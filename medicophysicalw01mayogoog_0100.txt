T rau experiments of Boyle have proved beyond doubt
that air is eminently elastic and therefore spreads and
expands immensely when relieved from the pressure
of the atmosphere. But it is not so clear to what
cause the elastic force of the air is due. I shall, how-
ever, state briefly the result of my reflections on this
recondite subject.

In the first place, then, I take it for granted that the
air contains certain particles termed by us elsewhere
nitro-aerial which are absolutely indispensable for the
productiori of fire, and that these in the burning of
flame are drawn from the air and removed, so that the
latter when deprived of these particles ceases to be fit
for supporting fire, as has been shown above.

It must also be admitted that the clastic force ol the
air is due to the same aerial particles as those by
which flame is supported-an inference which we
deduce from the fact that air deprived of these nitro-
ae'rial particles loses clastic force, as will be established
by what follows.

For firstly we have to note, what almost everybody
knows, that if a cuppingÎ‡glass filled with flame be
applied to the skin, the flame will soon go out and the
space within the cupping-glass will be almost empty,
and as a consequence the skin will be driven into the
