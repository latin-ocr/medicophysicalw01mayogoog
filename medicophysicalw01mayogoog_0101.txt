hollow of the cupping-glass by the pressure of the sur·
rounding air. But now let us inquire why the space

within the cupping-glass becomes almost empty
immediately upon the extinction of the flame. One
might readily say here that the fiery and ae'rial par-
ticles are agitated iu the flame with a very rapid motion
andare much rarefied, but that after the extinction of
the flame they cease from their movement and are con-
densed, so that these particles are no longer able to
resist the pressure of the surrounding air. But this
answer does not seem quite satisfactory, for it is prob· ,
able that air is largely mixed with the flame, since it
supplies it with nutriment, so that not even the
smallest partos the flame is altogether destitute of air.
But if the air were distributed abundantly enough in
the flame‚ it does not appear that it would be condensed
alter the extinction of the flame to the extent required
for rendering the space in the cupping-glass so empty.

Wherefore I think it should be maintained that the
air mixed with the flame is, by the buming of the
dame, quickly deprived of its nitro-aerial and elastic
penicles, so that this air not only becomes unfit lor
sustaining fire but also loses in part its elasticity.
Hence when a flame enclosed in a glass vessel has
exhausted the nitro-aerial particles of the air, it soon
goes out and the space contained within is like a
vacuum, not only on account of the diminished motion
of the igneous penicles, but partly also from the lack
of elastic particles, as will appear more evident from
the following experiments,

F 01 instance, let a buming candle be placed in water
so that the wick may stand about six finger-breadths
above the water, and then let an inverted cupping-
