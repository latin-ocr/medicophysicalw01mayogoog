light, as is shown in Plate V., Fig. 1. Care, how-
ever, must be taken that the surface of the water
enclosed within the glass be at the same level as the
water without. But that this may be attained in the
present experiment‚ and also in those that follow, let
one leg of an inverted syphon be enclosed within the
cavity of the cupping-glass before it is put into the
water while the other leg projects outside, yet so that
the end of each leg may be above the surface of thewater,
as is seen in the said figure. The use of the syphon is
to enable the air enclosed 'in the alembic, and corn-
pressed by the underlying water while the glass is
being let down into the water, to pass out through the
cavity of the syphon, so that the water within may
not be depressed below the level of the water outside,
as it would otherwise be. But when the air ceases to
pass through the syphon (which will happen almost in
an instant) the syphon should be at once withdrawn,
, that the air may not afterwards rush through it into
the glass. When these arrangements are made let the
cupping-glass be firmly fixed so that it may descend
no further into the water, and you will presently see,
while the light still burns‚ the water rising gradually
into the cavity of the cupping-glass.

I will not deny that the ascent of the water arises in
part. from the circumstance that when the light is
about to expire, the air enclosed in the cupping-glass
is less agitated and rarefied by the igneous particles
than formerly. But the rise of the water into the
glass must not be ascribed to this cause alone, since it
is partly due to this, that the lamp enclosed in the
glass is, by its own burning, deprived of nitro-aerial and
elastic particles so that the air there is not able as be-
fore to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. And this
will be further confirmed by the following experiment.
