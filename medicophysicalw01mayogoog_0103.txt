For let any combustible material which will readily
take fire be suspended in an inverted cupping-glass as
large as can be had, as is shown in Plate V., Fig. 1 (I am
mysell in the habit of suspeuding a bit of camphor to
which a small piece of linen, charred in the usual way
into tinder and dipped in melted sulphur, is attached).
When this has been done, let the inverted cupping-
glass be immersed in the water about ten finger-
breadths so that the water enclosed in the glass may
be at thesaure level as the water outside, which can be
done, easily enough, by means of the bent syphon
already described 3 and lastly, let the water outside be
drawn off until the level of the water within is higher
than that of the water outside, so that it may be more
distinctly seen, or better, let the cupping-glass be trans-
ferred to another and shallower vessel by placing
under it a small vessel, big enough, however, to receive
the mouth of the cupping-glass, and then transferring ’
the small vessel filled with water, together with the
cupping·glass resting upon it, into a suitable vessel
almost full of water. And let the cupping-glass remain
there until the air heated by the hands of the operator
hasbeen condensed to its original state. And then,
lastly, let the height of the water within be noted by
papers affixed here and there to the sides of the
glassby means of a paste made ol barley·meal boiled
in water. Now let the cupping-glass be exposed to
the rays of the sun and let the canrphor or other com·
bustible matter enclosed in it be kindled by means of
aburning-glass, by first lighting the aforesaid sulphured
linen placed under thecombustible matter. When this
has been done you will see the water within descend on
account of the agitation of the fiery particles, and the
rarefaction of the air inside. When the light has gone
out let the cuppingglass and the small vessel on which
