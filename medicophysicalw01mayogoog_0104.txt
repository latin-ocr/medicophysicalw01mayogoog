On Sal Nitrum and Mtro-Aerial spirit 71

it rests be removed from the sun's rays, that the air
enclosed in it may cool again and return to its former
condition, and then you will find that the water within
has risen above the point marked at first. And indeed
I have found by calculation that the air has been
reduced in volume by about one-thirtieth by the burn-
ing of the light.

After the smoke of the burning light with which the
cupping-glass was filled had entirely disappeared and
the glass had become as bright within as at first, Itried
to kindle the light in it a second time by throwing the
solar rays upon another piece of camphor, suspended in
the glass in the same way as before, but the experiment
did not succeed—a sufficiently clear proof that the air
had been, by the burning of the light, deprived of its
igneo-aerial particles, so as to be quite unfit for sustain·

ingflameanew. But lest any one shouldthinkthat the ·

light could not be kindled a second time in the glass,
because the inner sides of the glass had been dimmed
so much by the smoke of the light previously burned
init that the rays of light could not be transmitted
through the glass with sufficient intensity, 1 fasten a
piece of paper about a hand-breadth broad, with its
margins all round coated with the aforesaid paste, to
the inner side of the cupping-glass at the place where
the solar rays are to be transmitted. When the fumes
have entirely vanished this paper is to be pulled off,
bya thread attached to it and extending outside the
vessel, so that the solar rays may pass through the part
of the glass which has been protected from the soot.
It is a further confirmation of our hypothesis that
the air given out from the lungs of animals has its
elastic force diminished in consequence of the loss of
its nitro-aerial particles, as will be manifest from the
following. '
