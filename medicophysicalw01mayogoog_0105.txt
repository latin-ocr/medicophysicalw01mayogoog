Let a moistened bladder be stretched over the cir,
cular orifice of any vessel and tied to it just as the skin
ofa drum is stretched; then let a small bell-jar in which
alittle animal, say a mouse, has been put, be accurately
applied to the said bladder by placing a weight upon
the jar lest the animal inside should upset it (as is
shown in Plate V., Fig. 2). When things have been
arranged in this manner it will in a short time be seen
that the jar is firmly fixed to the bladder; and the

bladder also, at the place where it lies under the jar, is Ι

forced upwards into the cavity oi the glass just as if
the jar had been applied with a flame enclosed in it.
And this will take place while the animal is still
breathing. Nay, if the jar be grasped by the hand and
raised, the bladder, along with the vessel, will still
adhere firmly to it unless the vessel is very heavy.
And indeed a little animal placed in a cupping-glass

which is to be fixed to the skin can supply to a small
extent the place of the flame. And from this it is
clear that the elastic power of the air enclosed in the
aforesaid jar has been diminished by the breathing of
the animal, so that it is no longer able to resist the
pressure of the surrounding air.

But in order that this matter may be better under-

stood, let me submit yet another experiment to the
same effect-an experiment moreover from which it
will be easy to perceive in what proportion the air is
diminished as to its volume when deprived of vital
particles by the breathing of the animal. Thus, let a
small animal placed on a suitable support be enclosed
in an inverted glass, or better, let the animal be put
into a suitable cage and suspended in a glass jar just as
the vessel is suspended in Plate V., Fig. 4. Then let
the inverted glass be sunk a little into the water so
that the water enclosed in the glass may stand at the
