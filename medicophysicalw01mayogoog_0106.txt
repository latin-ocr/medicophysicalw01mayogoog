same level as the water outside, as may be done by
means of the bent syphon already described. When
this is done let the water outside be, drawn off a little
in order that the height of the water within may be
better observed. And let it be indicated by papers
attached here and there to the sides of the glass. And
so you will soon see the water sensibly rising into the
cavity of the glass‚ although the heat produced by
the presence of the animal in the glass, and also
the breath proceeding from it, might be expected rather
to produce an opposite effect.

But we can perceive in the following way the extent
to which the air enclosed in the glass undergoes con-
traction before it becomes unsuitable for sustaining
animal lif . For let the space in the glass occupied by
the air when the animal was at first placed in it and
also the space occupied by the same air when the
water has risen in the glass after the suffocation of the
animal be measured‚ as can be done by pouring water
into those spaces so as to fill them and measuring it—
but warning should be given here in passing that when
these spaces are thus measured everything should
remain in the glass the same as before. And now let
it be ascertained by calculation how much the first
space is greater than the second. For to that extent
the air is lessened as to its elastic force and volume by
the breathing of the animal. And in fact 1 have
ascertained from experiments with various animals
that the air is reduced in volume by about one-
fourteenth by the breathing oi the animals. But
care should be taken in making this experiment that
the animal be placed only a little above the surface of
the water, for a reason to be afterwards given.

From what has been said it is quite certain that
animals in breathing draw from the air certain vital
