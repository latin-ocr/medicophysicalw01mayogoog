aud there, through the whole mass ol the lungs. And
yet in the lungs, when boiled and dissected, an almost
infinite number of openings resembling most minute
points are seen by the aid of the microscope. But
whether these points are the mouths of capillary
tracheae, or of vessels opening into the blood, I cannot
state with certainty.

Hence it is manifest that air is deprived of its elastic
force by the breathing of animals very much in the
same way as by the burning of flame. And indeed
we must believe that animals and fire draw particles
of the same kind from the air, as is further confirmed
hythe following experiment.

For let any animal be enclosed in a glass vessel along Ἰ
with a lamp so that the entrance of air from without
is prevented, which is easily done ifthe orifice of the

inverted glass be immersed in water in the manner
already described. When this is done we shall soon
see the lamp go out and the animal will not long
survive the fatal torch. For l have ascertained by
experiment that an animal enclosed in a glass vessel
along with a lamp will not breathe much longer thau
half the time it would otherwise have lived. Α

Nor is there any reason for supposing that the
animal is suffocated by the smoke of the lamp, for
scarcely any smoke will emanate from it if spirit of
wine is used, and indeed the animal will live in the
glass for some time after the extinction of the lamp-
that is, after the fumes have entirely disappeared-so
that it is by no means to be supposed that it has been
suffocated by the fumes of the lamp. But since the
air enclosed in the glass is in part deprived of its nitro·
adrial particles by the burning of the lamp, as has
already been pointed out, it cannot support long the
breathing of the animal, hence not only the lamp but
