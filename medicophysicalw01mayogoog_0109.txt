also the animal soon expires for want of nitro-aerial
particles. ·

But the reason why an animal can live for some
time after the extinction of the lamp seems to be this.
lt is only by a continuous and moreover an abundant
and rapid stream of nitro-aerial particles that a lamp
is sustained. Consequently if the succession of nitro·
aerial particles be but for a moment interrupted‚ or if
they are not supplied in due abundance, the flame will
immediately sink down and expire. Hence as soon as
the nitro-aerial particles begin to come but sparsely
and slowly to the flame it presently goes out. But a
s'maller ration of aerial nourishment and that intro-
duced at intervals will suffice for animals3 so that an
animal can be sustained by the adrial particles remain-
ing after the extinction of the flame. It supports this
view that the movement of the subsiding lungs con-
duces not a little to draw in the aerial particles if any
remain in the said glass and to carry them into the
blood of the breathing animal. Hence it results that
the animal does not die until the ae'rial particles have
been entirely exhausted. And hence it is that the air
in which an animal is suffocated is contracted in
volume by more than twice as much as that in which
a lamp goes out, as was formerly pointed out.

Further, having suspended combustible matter in a
glass vessel beside an animal‚I tried to ignite it by
means of a burning-glass after the animal was suffo-
cated, and that that might if possible succeed,I pro-
tected from the breath of the animal the side of the

glass through which the solar rays were to be
transmitted, by means ofa piece of paper fixed to it
as already described. But the experiment did not
succeed. 1 shall not, however, make any certain pro-
nouncement in regard to this, because wintry weather
