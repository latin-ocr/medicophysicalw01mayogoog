On Sal Nzitrum and ll'z'tro-Ae'rial Spirw 77

and a sky almost constantly wrapped in clouds pre-
vented me from repeating the experiment. It is
probable, however, that air which is unsuitable for
supporting life is also incapable of producing dame,
since a greater quantity of aerial particles is needed
for the buming of a lamp than for sustaining life. But
it is to be noted here that although flame and life are
sustained by the same particles it is not on that
account to be supposed that the mass of the blood is
really on tire, as will be shown in the next chapter.

But assuredly difficulties by no means slight occur
in connection with what has been said. For, in the
first place, how should it be that an animal or a lamp
enclosed in these glass vessels is unable to survive while
a sufficient abundance of air is contained in them?
For the water underneath ascends into a part only ol
these glasses and the remaining space is filled with air,
and that air although diminished in volume is yet
able to resist the pressure of the surrounding air.

Further‚ in what way shall we suppose that the air
in the aforesaid glasses loses its elastic force? For we
must believe that air is contained in them in undi-
minished quantity after the extinction of the flame
and the death of the animal. For the aerial particles
are not annihilated by the buming of the flame or the
breathing of the animal. Nor are they driven out of
the glass, for neither air nor any other elastic matter
mixed with it is able to penetrate glass, as we have
indicated above ς for otherwise the pressure of the air in
the glass could not be removed or diminished by any
suction, inasmuch as the air or the elastic matter would
immediately enter the glass from which the air had
been exhausted and fill the space left by the air, especi-
ally since the pressure of the surrounding air assists
towards their entrance.
