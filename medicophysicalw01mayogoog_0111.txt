78 Mayow

Since then the air still remains in these vessels, shall-
we suppose that it has been condensed and that the
ascent of the water results from this? But neither is
this the case, for we note that the water in the glass
in which the light has gone out rises above its former
level while the air is not yet completely cooled.
And indeed the heat caused by the presence of the
animal is fitted to produce rarefaction rather than
condensation. Besides if the air underwent no other
change than condensation only, there is no reason why
the lamp or the animal should not have been sustained
by it. Should any one happen to say that the elastic
force of the air was diminished by the respiration of
the animal because some part of the air entered the
blood of the animal, I reply that the blood of the
animal, when it was enclosed in the glass at first, con-
tained an equal and even a larger supply than after-
wards of aerial and elastic particles and it therefore
follows that some elastic particles must pass out from
the blood of the animal into the glass pari passu with
others that enter in, and consequently that elastic
particles must be contained in the glasses after the ¹
animal has breathed for some time in it in no less
abundance than before. Nay, even although more
adrial matter should enter the blood of the animal
thanis given out from it, still it would continue to
exist in the glasses‚ and in accordance with its elastic
nature would occupy as much space as otherwise.

But, to make a conjecture on this difficult subject, let

us consider in how many ways the elastic force of

bodies may originate. And, in the first place, we
notice that ⁸the particles of all
