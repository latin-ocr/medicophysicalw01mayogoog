On Sal Nitrum and Nitro-At'rzizl szir't 79

it is probable that some subtle and nimble matter
interspersed with aerial particles and continually
agitating them conduces not a little to the expansive
force of the air. And in this way the elastic force of
the air seems to be increased when heat is com·
municated to it, for the nitro-aerial particles (from
whose agitation we have concluded elsewhere that
heat arisesl strike the ae'rial particles and keep them
in motion, but these when moved tend to unfold.
But indeed it is scarcely credible that the elasticity of
air depends on this cause alone; because when the
lamp or the animal is shut up in the aforesaid glasses,
the a'e'rial particles there, being heated by the flame or
by the presence ol the animal, would necessarily be set
in motion, and therefore the elastic force of that air
would be rather increased than diminished, if it
resulted merely from the movements of aerial
particles.

2. Elastic force, or the power of recoil, arises from
the bending ol rigid bodies inasmuch as these when
bent strive to return to their original form. And
indeed it is probable that the elasticity of the air
results mainly from this very cause. It would certainly
be reasonable to suppose that nitro-aerial and fiery par·
ticles are fixed in the a'e'rial particles themselves and
constitute the more active part of them. For although
aerial particles are very minute and are commonly re·
garded as most simple and elementary, still it seems to
me necessary to suppose that they are compound and
that some of their parts are branchy and adhere firmly
to each other as il by mutually clasping hooks; while
others are extremely subtle, solid, smooth, agile, fiery
and truly elementary, and that these when firmly
fixed' among the other particles make them rigid in
much the same way as rigidity and elasticity are in·
