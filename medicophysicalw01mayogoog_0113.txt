duced in iron by nitro-adria] particles communicated
to it from sire, as I previously endeavoured to show.
Ι am also of opinion that the elastic force of the air
consists in this that the particles of the air becuming
rigid, and compressed and bent by the weight of the
incumbent atmosphere, strive to spread themselves
out.

Certainly the rigidity of the ae'rial particles seems
to be the cause of their not entering the minute
pores of bodies so readily as the grosser particles
of watery liquids, as could be established by very many
experiments. For although a'e'rial particles are very
minute, yet on account of their rigidity they cannot
adapt their forms, like the flexible particles of watery
liquids‚ to the tortuous passages of bodies. Hence also
it seems to come about that water ascends in very
minute glass tubes and also into the pores of a sponge
and other things of that kind. For although rigid
particles of air cannot enter extremely fine little pores
of that sort, yet water is forced up into them as into an
empty space by the pressure of the remaining air.

To this I add further that the rigidity of ae'rial
particles appears to contribute not a little to the
kindling of fire, inasmuch as the nitro-ae'rial particles
on being violently torn from the particles of the air in
which they were firmly fixed are thrown into very rapid
motion, for otherwise 1 do not see how the nitro-
ae'rial particles could begin so rapid a movement. But
of this more will be said afterwards.

But now it is probable that ae'rial particles when
mixed with flame lose their elasticity 1n the following
manner Thus we must suppose that the sulphureous
ι particles of lire, when thrown mto violent agitation‚
approach all the particles of air which are nearest

them, and rmpinge on the nitro-ae'rial particles which
