against the nitro-aerial particles and set them · in
igneous motion. .

l add further in confirmation os what has been sard,
that the nitro-aerial particles to which the elastic force
of the air is due are fixed in the aerial particles them·
selves and are torn from thern by the burning os a
lamp or by the breathing of animals; ior that the
nitro-aerial and elastic particles which are lacking 1n
the aiore-mentioned glass vessels are neither air rtself
nor some material interspersed among its particles, has
been shown above, and therefore it must be concluded
that the elastic particles are implanted in the particles of
the air themselves and constitute their more active part,
and that it is in fine because these are driven out from
the aerial particles by the burning oi fire or by the
brenthing of animals that air becomes quite effete and
destitute of elastic force.

That the igneo-aerial particles are not air itself pure
and simple, but only its more subtle part, may be
inferred besides from this, that nitro-aerial particleS,
whatever they be, exist in nitre and constitute its fiery
and a'e'rial part, as was shown above. But who cau
imagine that air itsclf resides in such abundance in
nitre as is required ior its burning in a place void of
air? If spirit of nitre be poured upon any fixed salt
when taken fresh from the fire, nitre will be produced
by their union ; but it is not to be supposed that air is
present in such quantity in either of these principles,
nor can we believe that air coalesces along with
these principles in the generation of nitre. Nor is it
probable that air without any force applied to it would
condense to such an extent as would have to be
supposed in the case of nitre if its burning resulted
from arr residing in it. For to the production of so
lmpetuous a flame as is produced by a small morsel of
