On Sal Nitrum and Nitro-At'rz'al spirit 83

nitre, no mean supply of air is required, bnt that so
much should be imprisoned in a small piece of nitre is
very unlikely‚ especially as it is only such air as is
possessed of a very high degree of elasticity that is
suitable for the production of ilame. But these points
will be still further established by the following experi-
ment.

For instance, let spirit of nitre and also salt of tartar,
or any other fixed salt dissolved in a small quantity of
distilled water, be placed in separate glass vessels and
enclosed in another sufficiently large glass vessel from
which the air is afterwards exhausted, as far as possible,
by means of an air-pump (indeed in the experiment
made by me the air was almost entirely pumped out).
When this is done, if any aerial or elastic substance
be present mixed with the aforesaid liquids, it will
escape in the form of bubbles when the pressure of
the ambient air is withdrawn. When the bubbles, if
there be any, no longer escape from the liquids (for it
is to be observed that from nearly every liquid when
in a place void of air small bubbles are wont to rise)
let the aforesaid liquids be mixed, and an intense,
effervescence will immediately be produced. Let
everything remain in this condition until the action
has entirely ceased, and then, lastly, let the mixture be
removed and evaporated at a mild heat to the dryness
of salt, and so at the bottom of the glass we shall find
nitre generated in an airless place, which in accordance
with the nature of nitre will, if placed on a burning
coal burst into flame; and yet it is by no means to be
supposed that air is present in nitre produced in this

way. Further, if nitre itself dissolved in distilled water
be put in a place empty of air, air in the form of
bubbles scarcely escapes at all from the solution—
certainly in a less degree than from common water-
