a clear enough proof that air is not so densely enclosed
in nitre.

It is thus evident that the igneo-airial particles
common to nitre and air are not air itself‚ but only
certain very subtle particles which fixed in air and in
nitre constitute their more active and fiery part. Indeed
it is probable that igneoa'e'rial spirit is fixed in the saline
particles of nitre very much in the same way as in the
aerial particles, and that it is in consequence of their
being violently torn from both kinds of particles and
thrown into violent agitation that fire is produced.

It will not be difficult to understand from this hypo-
thesis of ours why the water ascends in a glass in
which a lamp or an animal is enclosed, although air·
exists in it in the same abundance as before, and there
is no reason to suppose that it has condensed. For
no other conception is possible than that the elastic
force of the air hasbeen diminished‚ aud that this
is due to a certain change wrought in the abrial
particles themselves. But what that change should
be, which diminishes the elastic force of the air, unless
we suppose that the particles from being rigid become
flexible‚ l confess that I do not understand.

Further, in what has been already said the reason is
to be sought why lamp and animal when placed in the
aforesaid glass vessels expire even when air in sufficient
abundance seems to be contained in them. It must
not be supposed here that of the air enclosed in those
vessels a part has been entirely consumed while the
rest remains unchanged‚ because if that were so there
would be nothing to hinder the animal frorn still
breathing in it. But it must rather be thought that·
nearly all the particles ol the air have undergone some
change, and that they have been deprived to such an
extent of nitro-aerial particles that the air has become
