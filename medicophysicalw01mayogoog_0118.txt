On Sal Nitrum and M'tro-Ae‘rzial spirit 85

quite unfit to sustain life andflame. But then you will
say that the air enclosed in the glasses is still possessed
of sufficient elastic force to resist the pressure of the
ι atmosphere‚ so that it would seem not to have been
deprived of its nitro-aerial and elastic particles. And
how then can it be that an animal or a lamp cannot
be sustained by it? Nay, I have ascertained that the
air in which an animal or a lamp has expired is
possessed os no less elastic force than any other air,
lor when the pressure of the atmosphere is removed
it expands with no less vigour than common air,
as will be shown in Chapter X. But this seems
flatly to contradict what has been said on this matter.
The answer to be given to this difficulty is,l think,
that the elastic force of the air referred to does not
result from the elasticity of its a'e'rial particles'being as
intense as that of unaltered air, but rather from this,
that as aerial particles when deprived ol nitro-aerial
particles become less rigid‚ so they are also more bent
by the pressure of the atmosphere ; but a weaker rigid
body, provided it has been greatly bent aud stretched,
will have no less elastic force than a stronger rigid
body less bent by the very same force. lt should be
also noted that the elastic force of the said air results
in part also from this, that as that air deprived of
elastic particles is reduced to narrower space. aerial
particles iu air of this sort are aggregated in greater
abundance and more densely than in common air.
Here we remark in passing that if the elastic force
of the air resulted from certain agile particles inter·
spersed in it, and if these were exhausted by the
breathing ol the animal or the buming of the lamp,
then air in which an animal or alamp has been enclosed
would by no means expand with as much force as
unaltered air. So that even by this it is clearly proved
