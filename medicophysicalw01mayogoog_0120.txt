other. It must not be supposed here that the vapours
expired by the animal occupy the top of the glass and
exclude the air from that part 32 for these vapours
soon condense and adhere to the sides of the glass;
for otherwise the underlying water would be depressed
by them. But it would be reasonable t0 think that
the particles of air expelled from the lungs of animals
become lighter, because the nitro-aerial particles are in
part removed from them, and that they rise in conse·
quence to the top of the glass; and that, being more
densely crowded there, they are capable of resisting
the pressure of the air below and of excluding it, but
are nevertheless unfit to sustain life; while at the
same time the air at the bottom of the glass remains
unchanged and the animal placed there is still able to
breathe. It is also worthy of notice that when a small
animal, say a mouse, is shut up in a Ι811155 and suffers
from want of air, it turns its mouth hither and thither
in an upward direction in quest of breath; but when
it perceives that it suffers more there from want of
breath it is wont to bring its mouth downwards, and
when it gets alittle refreshment there it pushes its
mouth as far down as it can into the glass and keeps it
there.

As an animal, so also a lamp expires sooner when
placed in the upper than in the lower part of the
glasS‚ although this should perhaps be ascribed in part
to the smoke which occupies the top of the glass. N ay,
isan inverted bell-jar be suspended in the air and then
a lamp from which scarcely any smoke proceeds be
placed in it, you will. soon observe the lamp going
out, because the air contained in the glass is soon
rendered incapable of sustaining fire on account of the
burning of the lamp. But as it is lighter than the rest
ol the air, the surrounding air forces it upwards and does
