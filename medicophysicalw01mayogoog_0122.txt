HOW AIR WHEN DEPRIVED OF Nlrlro-AERIAL
PARTICLES IS SUPPLIED WI ΤΗ THEM ANE W

Since aerial particles, whether by the burning of
fires or the respiration of animals, are deprived in the
manner aforesaid of nitro-aerial particles, let us con-
sider how it is that air is not at last all consumed by
the buming of fires and the breathing of animals, or
at least rendered so effete as to be no longer able to
sustain flame and life. As to this, it may be supposed
that air when deprived of nitro-aerini particles and
therefore also of its elasticity and weight (as was pre-
viously shown) is impelled upwards by the pressure of
the rest of the air, and that when raised on high it is
then impregnated anew with nitro-aerial particles.
For indeed it is probable that nitro-aerial particles,
being extremely small and volatile, float in the higher
regions of the air, and that when collected there in
sufficient abundance they constitute, in accordance

with their diverse conditions, the elements either of .

fire or of cold.

With regard to the element offire, it is probable that
it dwells in the very body of the sun, which appears
to be nothing but an immense chaos of nitro-aerial
particles carried round in a perpetual whirl with the
swiftest motion. Indeed,I think, there is very little
difference between the light of the sun and its rays
collected by means oi a burning-glasS, in which nitro-
aerial particles are engaged in igneous motion without
aoeompanying sulphureous particles, as we have else-
where indicated. For although sulphureous particles
are required at first to put nitro-aerial particles in
motion and to kindle sublunary fires‚ still we must
suppose that the nitro-aerial particles in the sun, not
