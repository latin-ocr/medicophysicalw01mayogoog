now entangled in terrestrial particles but free from
every kind of impediment, will continue to eternity
‘their motions, once started, without the aid of sul·
phureous particles; since, indeed, inanimate things
will never suspend their movements unless they are
hindered by some cause. F urther, we must suppose
that nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles never
remain long in the same place, since they mutually
ward off and repel each other in consequence of a
natural antagonism3 and hence it is that there must
be a continual supply of nitro-adrial and of sulphureous
particles for producing sublunary fire. Yet since the
solar light has lasted for so many ages, it is probable
that nitro-aerial particles, free from the presence of
sulphureous particles, move with the greatest velocity
in it. The rays of light will be considered later.

As nitro-aerial particles agitated with swiftest motion
constitute the solar body and fiery chaos, so probably
those pretty near the sun move with their velocity
somewhat abated and are intensely hot without burn-
ing. But at a greater distance from the sun ; namely,
in that region of the air which is commonly called
mid-air and is near the poles of the world, it is probable
that they cease altogether from their whirling move-
ment and are either altogether at rest or advance
pointwise‚ erect like spears, and that in this state
they constitute that other element of cold. For it
appears to me that we must certainly maintain that
cold is something positive and does not consist in this
merely that the particles of bodies cease from all

motion, as some have imagined; for the effects of
cold are of such a kind as cannot result from mere
privation of motion,as we have shown above. Moreover,
that nitro-aerial particles are lodged in ample enough
plenty in mid-air is evident from the fact that that
