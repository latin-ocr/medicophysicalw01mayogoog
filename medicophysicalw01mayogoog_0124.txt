region is extremely cold and that vapours to some
extent freeze in it. For the air in the middle region
is at least as cold as that which rests on the top of the
loltier mountainS, which in fact does not permit the
suow there to melt even in mid-summer, as was
remarked by the illustrious Descartes. But I have
endeavoured to show above that intense cold and the
congelation of vapours are due to nitro-aerial particles.
Further, that nitro-aerial particles are crowded in the
highest region of the air seems to be confirmed by the ι
blue colour of the sky; for as nitro-aerial particles,
when urged with swiftest motion, glow and fiame, so
when they move more slowly, or when their motion
ceases altogether, they assume a blue colour. And it
is an indication ol this that the flame of sulphur is
blue; for the nitro-aerial particles do not move so
swiftly in it as in other flames, as has been elsewhere
stated. And hence it would seem that when flame is
about to expire in subterranean crypts, or even from
the lack ol sulphureous nutriment, the nitro-aerial
particles in it do not shine brightly as in other
circumstances but take a blue colour on account os
their diminished motion. To these I add, lastly, that
iron and other very rigid substances of the same kind
appear blue when polished on account of the nitro-
ae‘rial particles densely fixed in them.

These things being admitted, it is reasonable to
suppose that a'e'rial particles when deprived, whether
by the burning of fire, or by the breathing of animab,
or in any other way, of their nitro-aerial particles and
consequently of their weight and elasticity, are driven
upwards by the pressure of the rest of the air, and
that they ascend until they arrive where nitro-atirial
particles moving with the greatest rapidity constitute
the element of fire ε further, that the a'e'rial particles on
