its effects upon plants and other natural things—it

published some time ago various considerations in-

that, namely, which makes it so necessary, is that
particles of a certain kind, absolutely necessary for the
support of animal life, may be separated from the air
by means of the lungs and mixed most minutely with
the mass of the blood, and in confirmation of our
opinion we brought forward in the previous chapter
experiments by which it was shown that the air
expelled from the lungs of animals is deprived of
