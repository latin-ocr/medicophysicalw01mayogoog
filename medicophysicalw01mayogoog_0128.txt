On Sal Nt'trum and Miro-Amal Spirat 95

bell-jar may be at the same level as the water outside‚
as may be done by means of a syphon, the form
and mode of use of which were described in the
preceding chapter. Then let the water outside be
drawn off until it is lower than the water inside by
about three finger-breadths. And let everything
remain thus until the air enclosed in the glass, heated
by the hands of the operator, has returned to its former
state. And then, lastly, let the height of the water
within be noted by papers attached here and there to
the outer surface of the glass, as is shown in the
aforesaid figure.

And now let the aforesaid small pieces of iron be
lowered by means of the string, the end of which
hangs outside‚ into the vessel which contains the
spirit of nitre. And so a very intense action will
soon be excited and the water within will at once be
depressed by the vapours thence arising

After action of this sort has gone on for the third
part of an hour more or less, or rather when the
water within has been depressed about three finger-
breadths by the vapours produced, let the pieces of iron
be lifted out of the vessel by means of the aforesaid
string. This done, after a short time you will see the
water within gradually rising, and in the course of an
,hour or two you will see it far above the height first
marked. F or the water which was quickly depressed
by the aforesaid vapours about three finger-breadths
below the point first marked, now rises some three
finger-breadths more or less above it; so that about
afourth part of the space in the glass which was
previously occupied by air is now occupied by the
water rising within. And indeed the water which has
risen in this way in the glass will not, even aster a long
· time, fall to the original mark.
