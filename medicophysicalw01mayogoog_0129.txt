So that clearly we must conclude that the air con-
tained in the glass has its elastic force diminished by
about one-fourth part, in consequence of the said
action produced by the spirit ol nitre encountering
tlie iron. Hence it is unable to make the same resist-
ance as previously to the pressure of the atmosphere‚
and consequently the water underneath is impelled
upwards into the glass.

Further‚ alter the vapours in the said glass have
been as lar as possible condensed and the water inside
does not rise any higher, let its height be indicated as
before by pieces of paper. Then let the iron be
lowered a second time into the vessel containing the
spirit of nitre, that action may be excited anew. But
that this may the better succeed, an ample supply of
spirit ol uitre ought to be put into the vessel, or
rather two vessels containing spirit olnitre, and also two
small portioris ol iron, should be suspended in the glass.
When the water sinks anew about five finger-breadths
in consequence of the vapours produced, let the iron
as before be taken out ol the vessel, and when this is
done the water will gradually rise in the glasS, yet not so
quickly nor so far as the first time. For the water
which rose after the first action about six finger-
breadthS, aud far indeed above the height first marked,
will only rise after the second, even should it be more
intense, some two finger-breadths more or less. Nay,
it will never rise to the mark from which it fell. If the
action be repeated a third time the result will be just
the same as in the second,

Now it seems extraordinary that the water which,
after the effervescence first excited, was raised far above
the height from which it sank, should alter the second
action, though brought about in the very same way,
not even recover its former height. For what are
