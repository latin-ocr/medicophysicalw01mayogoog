clearly opposite effects seem to be produced from the
same cause. Nor was any error committed in making
the experiment‚ for when often repeated the result .
was always the sames

But now to submit our views in explanation of the ·
phenomenon, it is in the first place probable l say that
not only the air which was contained in that part of

the glass in which the water rose after the first action,
but that nearly all the air in the glass was impaired
by the first action. For we notice that in about two
hours after the said action the water had risen so as to
occupy a fourth part of the glass more or less. But it
is not to be supposed thatin that space of time the
exhalations or vapours produced by the action were
entirely condensed. Nay, they will never entirely
become liquid, as will be shown below, Let us
suppose then that this exhalation is contracted to the
extent of a half by condensation (for Ι have ascertained
in a way to be described below that exhalations of that
kind will only condense to the extent of about a half
in so short a time as that in which the water rose in
the glass)‚ and it follows that the space in the glass,
including that into which the water did not rise, is
about half occupied by exhalations not yet contracted 3
since this has undergone a contraction equal to half
the space which is left in the glass before the water
could rise in it.

And in this a reason must be sought for the water
not rising, after the action set up the second time,
above the mark from which it was depressed. No
doubt the effervescing particles which issued from the
previous action being mixed in great profusion with
the aerial particles, impaired them in the way to
be described below; and the water in consequence

rose into the space which was left not only by the
