condensation of the exhalations· but also by the re-
moval of the air. But since the air in the glass was ior
the most part impaired by the first fermentation, or
rather had its clastic force diminished astar as possible,
hence it is that the water‚‘after the action brought
on the second time, ascends in the glass only to the
extent that the exhalations produced undergo con·
densation‚ and consequently much less than in the
previous case. And since these exhalations will never
be completely condensed, it follows that the water will
never rise to the point from which it was depressed.

As to the manner in which the air contained in the
aforesaid glass lost its elastic force, it is not to be
supposed that it was condensed on account of being
cooled by the saline exhalationS, for the water rose in
the glass while it was still warm from the action.
Nay‚ if the glass be warmed by placing it near the
fire so that the water contained in it may be rarefied‚
the water underneath can yet scarcely be depressed to
the level first marked, even when the heat is intense ;
and when the glass cools it will rise again to its
former height.

Nor is it probable that the air coalesces with the
particles given off in the action aud is as it were
coagulated since it will not submit to so much com-
pression unless under a very intense force. Further,
these effervescing particles are turned into a sort of
yitriol which remains under the form of a liquid, but
1t is by no means probable that air in such quantity

can be imprisoned in so small a portion of liquid, 'as
was more amply stated in another place.

”Wherefore it is reasonable to suppose that the
aenal particles inasmuch as they are rigid, are rubbed ·
among the fermenting particles in the glasS, and

broken perhaps into very minute parts, so that the
