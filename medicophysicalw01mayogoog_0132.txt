On Sal Nitrum and Nrtro-A'e'mbl Spr‘rit 9'9

nitro-a'e'rial and elastic particles are struck out of thern,
and the air consequently is deprived of its elasticity,
and reduced to smaller volume, as was explained in the
previous chapter.

Aerial particles indeed appear to lose their elastic
force in the aforesaid action very much in the same
way as in frre, which has been elsewhere shown to be
nothing but a very impetuous fermentation. And
indeed 'it is probable that the heat produced by the
aforesaid action and also by others of the same sort, is
due at least in part to nitro-a'e'rial particles struck out
in that way from the air. And this seems to be con·
firmed by the fact that if a corrosive liquid be mixed
with a salt, or with a metal opposed to it, in a place
almost destitute of air, though the two when mixed
together effervesce in aconspicuous manner, yet the
heat produced by them does not seem to be so intense
as it would otherwise be-a fact which has been
noted also by the illustrious Boyle.

I made also an experiment in an exactly similar way
to ascertain whether fixed salts mixed with acid
liquids and other actions of that kind diminish the
elastic force of the air, and found as the result of
observation that‚if the elasticity of the air is to be
manifestly diminished, it is absolutely necessary that
the action should be of such a kind that the exhala-
tions of the fermentation should last for some time
and be disseminated through the air, or at least, that
the exhalations if suddenly produced should undergo
great condensation afterwards. For it is to be noted
that the air in the aforesaid glass is impaired by the
fumes dispersed through it even after the iron has been
taken out of the spirit of nitre and the fermentation in
the vessel has ceased. For otherwise if the air had
been injuriously affected only while the action lasted,'
