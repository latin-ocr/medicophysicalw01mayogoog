then the space left by the impaired air would have been
filled by the vapours emitted, and consequently the
water would not have risen in the glass except in so ’
far as these underwent condensation. But the water·
rose in the glass much faster than vapours of that·
kind usually condense, so that we must believe that it:
ascended not only into the place of the condensed
vapours but also into that of the air at that time
impaired. Indeed we must suppose that particles of
the liquid and of the metal, dispersed through the air·
and fermenting there, gradually rub its particles and.
diminish their elastic force. Hence if the vapours·
produced by any action are of such a sort as cannot.
last agood while in the air, the water will only ascend
into the space left by them on their contractiori by·
condensation. Ir therefore they are cf such a kind:
that they do not undergo notable condensation, the
water in the said glass will not rise above the limit·
first marked. Whenever,I say, the vapours generated
will occupy more space than is left by the impaired air,
then, however much the elastic soree of the air is.
diminished, it will not be observed in the said glass..
And hence it is that if action is caused in the glass by
spirit of nitre and a fixed salt being mixed, as also by oil
of vitriol and iron acting on each other, in the manner
aforesaid, the water will not rise above its original level..

It is to be noticed in passing that although the·
exhalation produced by the spirit of nitre and iron,
when acting on one another, will never pass into a.
liquid condition, as will be shown below, still it can
scarcely be thought that it is really air. For when the
fermentation was first produced in the aforesaid glass,
the air in it was for the most part impaired-at least
as regards elastic force-as was previously pointed out a
yet when the glass was almost filled with the exhalas
