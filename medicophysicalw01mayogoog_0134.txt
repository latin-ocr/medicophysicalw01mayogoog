On Sal Nitrum and Nz'tro-Ab'rial spirit 101

tion produced by the fumes, instead of with air, then the
water did not rise in the glass after the second action
:as it did before, because that exhalation could not,
like air, be diminished as to its volume by the ferment·
‘ing particles, but was on the contrary increased by
them. But this sort of exhalation will be discussed
more fully later.

After this experiment we must suppose that air
when breathed by animals loses its elastic force in the
·following manner. For I assume, in the first place,
that the mass of the blood is a liquid conspicuously in
a state of fermentation, as will be shown below. Since
then through the action of the lungs ae'rial particles
are mixed intimately and in the minutest parts with
its fermenting particles, it comes to pass that the adrial
particles have their elastic force diminished by the
[particles of the blood in the same way as by the
vapours of fermentation in the aforesaid glass. Indeed
it is probable that the fermenting particles of the blood
rub'the aerial particles interspersed among them and
strike out from them the nitro-aerial spirits, and that
at last the ae'rial particles, deprived of their nitro-aetial
and elastic particles, become unfit for sustaining life
and lose besides a part of their elasticity.

Now that we have introduced nitro-aerial particles
into the mass of the blood, the question at once
'follows what use they serve. 1 discussed this subject
‘in my treatise on Respiration published a good while
ago, Let me be permitted, however, to add some
things here. It is our opinion, then, that as in
vegetables so also in animals, nitro-aerial particles are
the principal instrument of life and motion.

For in the first place nitro-a'e'rial spirit when mixed

with the saline-sulphureous particles ol the blood
appears to excite in it vital fermentation. ln fact, just
