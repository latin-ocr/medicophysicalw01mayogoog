as nitro-aerial particles when they slowly enter the

pores oi the earth encounter there saline-sulphureous

particles, immature indeed, in an obscure fermentation

on which, as has been shown elsewhere, the life of
plants depends; so the same nitro-aerial particles

when introduced more profusely into the mass of the

blood by the action of the lungs, and mixed in their

minutest parts with its saline-sulphureous particles,
brought to a state of active vigour, produce avery

marked fermentation such as is requisite for animal
life. For it is to be noted that blood consists of
the same particles as earth but in a more exalted state.
For as immature sulphur, when closely combined with
the seeds of a fixed salt, composes earthy matter, as has
been said elsewhere, so the mass oi the blood is
made up of saline-sulphureous particles raised to a
suitable volatility, and hence it is that both have
the same colour-to wit, a dark purple. Indeed 1
attempted to show above that nearly all fermentatione
of natural things result from the motion of nitro-aerial
particles; and in fact I have no doubt at all that the
effervescence of the blood is due to the same cause:
accordingly when respiration is arrested, the effer-
vescence of the blood immediately ceases and animal
life is extinguished.

And what confirms still more the view just stated is
the fact that the blood which entered the lungs with
a dark colour, returns from them more florid and
ruddy, as arterial blood is, as was observed ·by the
illustrrous Lower in vivisections. He also showed
that that change made in the mass of the
