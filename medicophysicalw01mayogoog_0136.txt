florid colom, although the blood at the bottom of the
vessel appears as a dark purple; and yet it too if
exposed to the air will after a short time become
ruddy. So that it is not surprising that the blood in
the lungs, where the air diffused through all its
particles mixes intimately with it, is rendered florid
throughout. .

And now we remark that air mixed with blood
produces the ruddy colour in it, since it sets up
fermentation in its mass. For arterial blood which is
florid has its particles in motion and also effervesces
conspicuously, while the darker and duskier venous
blood is more grumous and is more quickly coagulated
on account ol its feebler effervescence.

The following experiment also corroboratos the
view here taken. If blood that has been kept for
some time in a vessel be put into a glass from which
the air is exhausted by an air-pump, the blood at the
surlace where it was of a florid colour will effervesce
gently and rise in bubbles. But il arterial blood
while still warm be put in a place void of air, it will
expand in a remarkable way and rise in an almost
infinite number ofbubbles. And it ¹is probable that
this results partly from the effervescence of its particles
and their being thrown into movement, and partly
from its particles being mixed with air.

But to submit yet another experiment. If spirit ol
nitre be poured upon a liquid saturated with volatile
salt and sulphur, such as the spirit ol hartshorn
impregnated with its own oil, a very marked effer-
vescence and a very ruddy scarlet colour will be pro·
duced at once in the liquid, and yet this florid colour
changes into a dark purple when the liquid ceases to
effervesce. No doubt the nitro-aerial particles (and
we have elsewhere shown that the spirit ol nitre
