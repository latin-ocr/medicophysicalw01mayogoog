On Sal Nitrum and llsz'tro-Ae'rial Spr'rit 105

result which is due as Ι have tried to show elsewhere
to the motion oi nitro-aerial particles -How much
greater then will be the effervescence and heat of the
blood which abounds in saline-sulphureous particles
duly exalted, and with which a'e'rial particles are densely
:and in their minutest parts mixed by the action oi the ·
lungs? To this I add that the very intense heat which
animals experience when urged to violent motion, arises
partly because in violent movements there is very
great need ol increased respiration‚ and thus the nitro·
aerial particles introduced into the blood in greater
abundance will produce greater effervescence and heat
than usual; for the friction oi the limbs in the most
violent movements is not so great as to be able to ex-
cite so fervid a heat. Nay, if any one breathes, even
when at rest, but a little more intensely‚ he will soon
feel himself in an unusual glow ol warmth. However
the beat excited in animals by violent exercise is in
part also due to the effervescence ol nitro-aerini particles
and sulphureous particles, originating in the motor
parts, as will be pointed out elsewhere.

Iam not unaware that the learned Dr Willis in his
treatise on the Heat of the Blood has advanced various
arguments by which he endeavours to show that
the heat of blood is not due to its fermentation.
'lhis eminent man also asserts that liquido never
acquire heatzbfcrmcnting. But indeed it is evident
irorn common experience that all the thicker and
richer liquors‚ those namely which abound in saline-
sulphureous particles, such as strong ale and the
like, grow somewhat warm in the course of fermenta-
tion. However there is no kinship between any other
liquids and the mass of the blood, since the latter is so
thick that its particles do not exist in a fluid state
except when fermenting. Hence blood when drawn
