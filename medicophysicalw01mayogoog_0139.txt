off is soon coagulated aud acquires a certain consist-
ence. But such things as are possessed ol consistence,
even in the opinion ol this learned man, generate heat
in effervescing. Further, blood abounds beyond all
other liquids in saline-sulphureous particles, and nitro--
ae'rial spirits are densely and most minutely mixed
with them, and when these effervesco together, as it is
their nature to do,an intense enough heat must arise;
while in other liquids, fermentation is only produced
bya much more minute quantity of nitro-adrial and
saline-sulphureous particles. F urther, the nitro-adrial
spirit by which fermentation is excited in other liquids
is not supplied directly from the air with motion
and vigour but is innate in these liquids themselves,
wrapt in the embrace of the salt and fixed, as hasbeen
shown elsewhere.

But yet another difficulty brought forward by this

eminent man opposes what has been said—via, that the
aetion and beatos contrary salts efferveseing together

are zizcreased in e vacuum, as is proved by Boyle's
experimenta Wherefore, if the beat of the blood were

caused by its fermentatam, it would seem that it ought
to become more cirtense when the air is wathdrawn. But
on the contrary, af by suppressing respiration air is pre·
vented from enten'ng tlte blood, fermentatione soon eeases
and the animal quickly dies.

Ireply that from the fact that the fermentation of
the blood immediately ceases on account of want of
atr, it follows that it is caused by nitro-adrial spirit, as
has just been said.

Further, although contrary salts when mixed to·
¹gether, and other things of a like kind when ferment-
ing, expand and rise more in a place void of air than
elsewhere, still it is by no means on that account to
be granted that they effervesce more intensely. For
