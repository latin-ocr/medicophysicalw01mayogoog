action of contrary salts. But such things as have not
nitro-aerial particles contained in thern, such as the
mass of the blood, all saline-sulphureous minerals, and
likewise such things as ferment from extraneous
moisture and heat, effervesce only when nitro-aerial
particles reach them from the air. And this is the
reason why the fermentation of the blood subsides im-
mediately when the air is withdrawn.

But the reason why blood quickly coagulates when
drawn off, although exposed to the air, is because it is
necessary for the fermentation, and therefore also for
the preservation of the fluidityof the blood, that nitro-
¹adrial particles should be mixed densely and in very
minute parts with its saline-sulphureous particles, as
takes place in the lungs. And yet even blood that
has been shed effervesces at its suriace, that is, where
it is mixed with the air, as was previously shown.

From what has been already said, it is Ι think in
some degree made out that the fermentation of the
blood, and hence also its hear, arises from nitro·
adrial particles fermenting with its saline-sulphureous
particles; so that we do not need to have recourse to
an imaginary Vital Flame that by its continual burn-
mg warms the mass of the blood, much less to affirm
a degree of hear in the blood intense enough to produce
light,ir0m the rays of which, transmitted to the brain,
