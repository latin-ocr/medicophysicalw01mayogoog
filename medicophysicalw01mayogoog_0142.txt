is the mass of the blood in any way suitable for pro·
ducing flame; for although it consists of sulphureous
particles, yet these are held so firmly in the embrace
of the saline ones that blood will not burn, even when
thrown into the fire. But if any lire of this sort were.

to be thought that any flame is ever kindled which is
not luminous and also somewhat caustic and destruc·
tive, unless one is disposed ¹to palm off furnes for
flame. Nor is it credible that the vital flame is
extinguished in the blood as it rushes out ol the
vessels, for the air by blowing on ir is fitted rather to
excite than to extinguish fire. And lastly, what are
we to think ol the vital fire of aquatic animals? It,

The existence ol subterranean lires is not yet estab-

the brains ol animals, Ι ask how it is possible that this-
light which is supposed to enlighten with its rays the
whole brain and nervous system, should never be seen
by the eye. Truly, fires of this sort and new lights,
no less in Anatomy than in Religion, have always
seemed to me vain and fanatical.

With respect to the fermentation of the blood we
note further, that if the saline-sulphureous particles
in the mass of the blood have been too much elevated,
the nitro-aerial particles mixed with them will give
rise toa very impetuous effervescence and to febrile-
heat. And thus it is that an ulcer of the lungs pro-
duces a hectic lever; for the nitro-aerial particles,
