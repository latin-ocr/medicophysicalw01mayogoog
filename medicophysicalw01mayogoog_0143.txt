mixed with the too highly exalted saline-sulphureous
particles of purulent matter, excite a very intense
effervescence and febrile heat.

When saline-sulphureous and nitro-aerial particles
effervesco so much in long-continued severs, it comes
about that the volatile salts ol the blood are so worn
that they change at last, in the manner already
described, into aeid salts. And hence it is that the
blood acquires an acid nature alter long-continued
fevers3 indeed the case is not very different from
that of strong ale, which alter long fermentation is
converted into vinegar. Nay, even when the fer-
mentation of the blood goes on aright, its saline
particles are in course ol time sharpened and liquefied
by the action of the nitro-a'e'rial spirit, and in
combination with other (volatile) salts constitute a
certain acido-saline salt not very unlike Sal-Armoniac.
And thus it is that urine is impregnated with a certain
Sal-Armeniae, and the proof ol this is that copper
is eorroded by urine in the same way as by Sal·
Armoniac. Further, a solution of sulphur made in
lye is precipitated by urine poured on it just as by
any acid liquid. Hence il ashes have urine or even
blood mixed with thern, volatile salt will in distillation
be abundantly derived from them, inasmnch as the
lixed salt ol the ashes absorbs whatever of acid there
is in the urine, so that its volatile salt, freed from the
aeid salt, readily ascends, precisely as happens in dis-
tilling Sal-Armoniac mixed with fixed salt.

Besides the uses thus lar assigned to nitro-aerial
spirit, a very great many other offices are served by it.
For when nitro-aerial particles effervesce with the
massot the blood in the manner aforesaid, its saline·
sulphureous particles are brought to due volatility,
just as the sulphureous particles from terrestrial matter
