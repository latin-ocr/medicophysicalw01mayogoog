are brought to due maturity by the aid of nitro-a'e'rial
spirit, as has been shown elsewhere.

Further, in all the internal movements which take
place in the bodies oi animals‚ as in the digestion of
food, and also in that most intense effervescence which
gives rise to muscular contraction, nitro-aerial particles
play the chief part, as I shall attempt to show in the
fourth treatise.

CHAPTER IX

WHETHER AIR CAN BE GENERA TED ANE W

Now that we have shown above in how many ways -

airis impaired, it will not be out of place to inquire
whether it can be generated anew. On this pointI
shall introduce an experiment not very unlike the
one by the illustrious Boyle already referred to.
Let‚ then, spirit of nitre and spring water, mixed in

equal quantities‚ be placed in a glass vessel of sufficient
size. Then leta small glass be so placed under the
mixture that it shall be completely filled with the
liquid. This done, let two or three globules of iton
be placed at the mouth of this glass, and let it lie
inverted at the bottom of the other, as is shown in
Plate V., Fig. 3, care being taken that these globules
do not fall out ol the glass, and to secure this let the
mouth of this glass be closed with the finger or in any
other way, until it rests at the bottom of the other
glass. These preparations made, the acid menstruum
will, after a short time, corrode the iron globules and
effervesce conspicuously with them, and the exhala-
