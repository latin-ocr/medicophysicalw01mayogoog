tions caused by the effervescence will rise in the-
form of bubbles to ,the top of the glass and constitute
the air there, which, gradually increasing, will de·
press the underlying water. Let the glass, when it
is completely filled with air of this kind, be raised a.
little, that the iron globules, which are to be removed
from the liquid, may escape from it, care however
being taken that the mouth of the glass be not raised
above the liquid. And so we shall see that air which
occupied the whole glass, gradually condense, and the
underlying liquid rise into its place. And yet this
air will not all become liquid, for the glass will be
always about one-fourth filled with it; and this air,
however long kept, even in the coldest weather, will
never be condensed into a liquid. Il the iron globules
be placed under the mouth of the glass while it is still
inverted and put a second time into it, air will be
produced anew, a certain part of which will never
become liquid. So that the glass will be about half·
filled with exhalations that will never be condensed.

Il oil of vitriol mixed with water be substituted
lor spirit of nitre, or if a very sluggish fermentation
be excited in the manner described, or also if the
iron globules be allowed to remain in the glass for a
day or two, then the air generated in this way will
scarcely suffer condensation at all. For the partial
contractiori of the air in the aforesaid glass was due
to th1s, that the exhalations produced by violent
fernientation were agitated with a very rapid motion,
Whlch, gradually abating, the air was reduced to
”Palles bulk; while, if the fermentation has been
mlld and has gone on lor a long time, the exhalations
generated later will take up and fill the place lelt by

those previously condensed, so that the air will
scarcely suffer any condensation at all.
