the glass first described has been placed. And let the

orifice of the glass in which the air is, be placed in Α

the orifice of the other glass filled with water, as is
seen in Plate V., Fig. 5 (care being taken that the
mouth of neither of the glasses is raised above the
surface of the water), and let the glass be inclined
until the air contained in it escapes and ascends into
the other, glass, which can in this way be filled with
that air, although it is enough that a little of the air
be introduced into it.

And now the glass into which the air is transferred
in this manner, is to be enclosed in another glass from
which the air may afterwards be pumped by Boyle's
air-pump, which may be done in this way. Let a
vessel, not too large, but capable of admitting the
orifice of the glass in which the air has now been
collected, be put under it, and then let this vessel
filled with water be removed, with the other glass
inverted and resting upon it, and be put inside the glass
from which the air is to be pumped out. After the
air has been partly exhausted, the air enclosed in the
said glass will expand beyond the cavity of the glass,
and most of it will escape through the underlying
water. When the air hasbeen removed as faras
possible by the pump, let it be permitted to enter
anew. When this is done the water in contact with
the glass in which the aforesaid air is, will be driven
up into it on account of the pressure of the atmo-
sphere and will almost entirely fill it. For the air
which was left in that glass will occupy onlya part
of the narrower glass; and yet that small portion-of
air, a moment ago, when the pressure· of the sur-
rounding air was almost withdrawn, occupied the
whole glass, and was able to resist the pressure of the
surrounding water, and also of the air which could
