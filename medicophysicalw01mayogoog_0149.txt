inverted and placed under the orifice of the other
glass, and raised 111 11 111 the following manner. ,
Α transverse rod has to be attached, from the first, to
the 1111101 511105 01 1110 glass, as is seen in Plate V.,
Fig. 4. And let a string be so suspended from the
rod that both its ends, drawn from under the ori-
fice of the glass, hang outside. Then one end of
the string is to be tied to the bottom of the glass that
is to be raised, and the other end pulled till the glass
rises above the surface of the water inside. When the
water has fallen out of the glass which has thus been
pulled up in an inverted position, and air has taken its
place, let this glass be pulled down by means 01011-
other string previously fastened to its mouth, and taken
out 01 1110 other glass in such away· that its mouth
may remain continuously inverted3 and then, lastly,
the air contained in it may be transferred to the glass
first described, in the manner already shown.
Although air generated from the aforesaid fermen-
tation possesses no less elastic force than common air,
it does not on that account follow that it is really air
—viz., such as possesses vital and igueous particles.
For that air in which an animal or a light has expired
- possesses elastic force in an equal degree with inviolate
³1r, and yet it is destitute 01 111110-001101 01111 vital
particles. But 111 011101 10 determine whether this air
generated anew is fit for sustaining life or not, let the
following experiment be performed. But-before this
can be done, it is first of all necessary that air 01 that
sort be generated 111 sufficient abundante, which can
be done as follows without any great waste 01 1110
aforesaid liquid. Let a sufficiently large glass be 1111-
fnersed 111 water and filled with it, and let it romain
rnverted. And now let the air generated in a small
