portion of the air produced as before be conveyed in
like manner to the glass, and let this process be repeated
until the air is present in sufficient quantity.

And that we may now make our experiment, let a
small animal, say a mouse placed in a small cage‚ be
placed in the upper part of the cavity of an inverted glass
with asuitable support below it, as is delineated in Plate
