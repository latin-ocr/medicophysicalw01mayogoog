the second occasion would have survived twice as long
as the previous one. And the reason that the animal,
when the said air was put into the glass with it, lived
a little longer than it would otherwise have done,
appears to be that the air enclosed in the glass could
be more gradually and less copiously breathed and cor·
rupted by the animal in consequence of the admixed
arr.

Here, too, we might repeat our remarks in the
previous chapter on the difference between this sort
of air and common air. And yet it is probable that
there is a great likeness between air of this kind and
common air, and that the elastic force of both is due
to no very different cause. For since iron consists of
rigid particles‚ and the corrosive spirits consist of very
elastic nitro-aerial particles‚ as has been elsewhere said,
the air produced by their fermenting together will not
be very different from common air, inasmuch as the
latter appears to be formed of rigid particles‚ and these

imbued with nitro-aerial spirit, as I have elsewhere
endeavoured to show.
