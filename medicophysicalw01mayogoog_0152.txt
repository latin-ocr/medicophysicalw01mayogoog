On Sal Nitrum aud Miro-Adrial spirit 119

in fiery motion, agitate with their own velocity very
many others, and these in their turn others of the
same mass; so that indeed the smallest spark is
sufficient to cause a wide conflagration, which, yet, is
entirely contrary to the ordinary laws of nature. For in
other cases when one body in motion impels and moves
another at rest, the motion in both is diminished.
For a moving body which strikes another body and
moves it from its place, loses as much of its own
motion as it communicates to the other 3 so that

when a few particles set in motion a large number of
the same mass, the motion in each will be greatly
diminished.

That the burning particles in fire, then, should in-
crease their motions to such an extent, it seems to me
necessary that some other moving body should be
added to the ignited particles, to promote and intensify

their motion. And I think this is how it occurs. It
is no doubt probable that sulphureous particles when
divided most minutely‚ and violently agitated by the
application of fire or in any other way, impinge upon
the nitro-aerial particles residing in the particles of the
air, or ol common nitre, and drive' them into those
small spaces in which the subtle matter revolves with
swistest motion (as we showed above), but that the*
nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles, when driven
within the spherules which are described by that re·
volving matter, are driven further and forced out by it
with their motions greatly increased‚ and that at last
the nitro-aerial particles, on being violently sundered
in this way from the fixed salt of nitre, or from the
aerial particles with which they were previously most
firmly united, are thrown into a truly fiery motion.
Assuredly we must suppose that the sulphureous and
nitro-aeria] particles, and also the subtle matter, are
