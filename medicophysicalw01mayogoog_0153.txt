fashioned by the supreme Artificer with truly mar·
vellous skill, so as to be naturally adapted for throw·
ing each ,other into a motion os extreme velocity..
Indeed, not only in the burning of fire but in predum
ing most natural movements, we must assume as-
much skill and careful fitting of the mutually adapted.
particles, as in automata constructed with the most:
accurate human art. 1r any one should think that in
explaining spontaneous movements of this kind l arn
having recourse to things too minute, I reply that it.
is nature’s way to produce all the greatest things by·
means of the least, for how small and delicate arex
those spirituous particles which set the huge machinery
ol the elephant in truly stupendous motion? And
what is to be said ol the very small particles of¹
insects? For as their whole bulk is merely a point in
appearance, how minute must those portions be which·
we cannot suppose to be one-thousandth part of the
whole? Indeed I make bold to affirm that natural
movements. os this kind are effected by particles too-
minute for human discernment. -

Itis to be concluded from the foregoing that the.
ignited particles in the burning ol fire. are agitated‘
with elastic impulse, for just as we have shown above·
that the power ol recoil in bent rigid bodies is due to.
the pulsation of subtle matter, so also we maintain that
the motion of ignited particles results from impact of
the same matter. Indeed the burning of fire does not·
seem to be very different from the bending to fracture
of any rigid body, or rather of the asorementioned
glass drops. For as in bent rigid bodies, their particleS,
thrust within the cireles of the subtle matter, are·

struck by it, and at last, if the rigid body is bent to
breakrng, are violently driven out, so in fire the.
sulphureous and nitro-aerial particles, when they enter
