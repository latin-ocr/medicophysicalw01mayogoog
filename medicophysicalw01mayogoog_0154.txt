On Sal llb'trum and Mtrl-Arrzal spirit 121*

the minute pores ol the air or of nitre itself, and are:
impelled there into the spherules ol the subtle matter,
produce the same effect in the aerial particles, or on
. anything else impregnated with nitro-aerial particles,
as if, like rigid bodies, they were bent to breaking: sov
that the igneonitrous particles would appear to burst,
forth with elastic impetus from the air, not otherwise·
than the small bits of glass from the fractured glass„
It is a corroboration ol this view that aerial particles.
and the particles of nitre itself, in which, namely‚ igneo·-
nitrous spirit especially resides, become stiff like rigid
bodies and are imbued with elasticity, and are con--
sequently ol a sort fit lor having igneous particles shot
out of them with elastic impetus.

It would be easy to show here that nearly all natural
movements, such as the generation and dissolution
of things and the internal motions of opposed liquids,
are, similarly, to some extent due to the battering of'
the subtle matter. It is probable indeed that these·
motions are excited in the same way as fire is kindled ς.
for fire appears to be nothing but the most intense.
fermentation of nitro-aerial and sulphureous particles..
lt certainly does not seem to be sufficient to say with,
the eminent Willis in regard to these natural motions,
that the more active particles expand, ascend, and.
finally fly away 3 lor, in a discussion of this sort, what
should specially be shown is why particles at rest.
begin to move, lor whatever is at rest will remain
for ever at rest, if it is not set in motion by some
cause. With respect to motion of this kind, it appears.

to me necessary to suppose some perpetually moving
matter by the impulse of which these motions are-

effected. As then the very rapid motion ol fiery par-1
ticles seems to proceed from this, that the sulphureous.
particles coming up to the particles of nitre or ol air
