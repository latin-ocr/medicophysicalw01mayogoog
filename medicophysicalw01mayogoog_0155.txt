and there impinging upon the subtle matter agitated
with extreme velocity, are, by its impulse, thrust out
'with elastic violence along with the nitro-a'e‘rial par-
ticles which these substances contain3 so the rnilder
fermentation of natural things must be supposed to
arise from this, that nitro-aerini particles, along with ex-
traneous moisture, penetrate a saline-sulphureous mass
aud enter the abode of the subtle matter, by which, as
it is in violent agitation, the nitro-aerial together with
the sulphureous particles are driven off. For fiery
effervescence seems to differ only in this respect
from the milder internal rnotions by which plants
hasten to growth or decay, that in fire, nitro-aerial
particles, in close union with fixed salt or with aerial
particles‚ are, by the impulse of sulphureous particles
andos the subtle matter, violently sundered frons their
partner and thrown into very brisk motion ; whereas,
on the other hand, in the said fermentations, as the
sulphureous particles are not held so firmly in the
embrace of fixed salt, they are thrown into a milder
motion by the impactos the nitro-aerial particles and .
of the subtle matter. But these matters have been
more fully discussed elsewhere. Nor does the process
seem to be different in the effervescence of opposed
liquids, for when one of these intrudes into the pores

of another, and therefore also into the abode of the ’

subtle matter, and is expelled again, an internal move·
ment and effervescence of the particles is set up.

WHl' THE FORM OF FLAME IS ALWAYS
POINTED

As to fire, let us consider lastly why flame of every
sort rrses to a point. On this it is to be remarked,
sn the first place, that the sulphureous particles, burst·

mg out from the burning matter,.pass through the
