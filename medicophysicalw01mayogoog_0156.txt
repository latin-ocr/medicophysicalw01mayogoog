whole blaze and kindle flame everywhere in their
passage. For since the sulphureous particles, which
burn at the top of a lamp, have proceeded from the
wick, they must necessarily have passed through the
whole ol the intermediate flame. Further,it is not to
be doubted that these particles were burning from their
first entrance into the dame, since the lowest partos
the flame is produced only by the kindllng ol sul·
‘phureous particles. And hence it is that when a lamp
,goes out in consequence os a failure ol sulphureous
nutriment, the flame is last seen at the top and at
:some distance from the wick. For it is the last group
-ol sulphureous particles passing through the blare, and
everywhere in its transit kindling dame, that is seen at
the top of the blaze. But since no sulphureous par-
ticles now remain to follow these last ones, there must
be an interval without flame between the last burning
particles at the top of the flame and the wick.

But now the question arises why the sulphureous
particles at a certain distance from the wick no longer
kindleflame. For since the sulphureous particles burn
:at the extreme verge of the dame, they must conse·
¹-quently be in more 'violent motion there than when,
:as yet unkindled, they were about to enter the flame.
And therefore there seems to be more reason for these
particles, once kindled, persevering in their fiery
movement and flame, than lor their entering upon a
fiery movement at first. As to this, my opinion is
that the lire is extinguished at a certain distance
from the wick, not because the motion ol the sul-
phureous particles is diminished, but because, in their
passage through the flame, they are rubbed so much
‚and made so small and subtle by their own combus-
:tion that they become at last incapable of throwing

nitro-aerial particles into fiery movement. In lact,
