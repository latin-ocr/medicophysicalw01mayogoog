124 Mayow

for the formation of a flame, it seems to be necessary
that the sulphureous particles should neither be too
fixed nor very volatile. For we notice that the sul·-
phureous particles of spirit of wine and also the very·
subtle particles ol camphor, are scarcely able to throw·
nitro-aerial particles into fiery motion. And this is
the reason that the fire they make is but languid and
almost harmless. And indeed it is probable that -
sulphureous particles, in passing through the flamm
are rendered so subtle by their own burning that
they become quite unfit to produce fire. And this.
seems to be confirmed by the fact that if any polished
plate be placed in the flame of a lighted candle‚ we
shall soon see it covered with soot; but if the plate:
be held a little above the flame, no soot ‚will gather on
it. For the soot adhering to the plate seems to be
nothing else than the sulphureous particles which
shortly before were buming; now indeed they are· Ι
changed somewhat in consequence of their burning
and rendered more subtle and scorched. But those sul--
phureous particles which have burned longer, become:
at last so fine that they are incapable either of con-
stituting the grosser structure of soot or of producing·
flame. lt isa confirmation of this that the lower·
part os any flame is very different from the top. For·
the lower part is usually blue, while the upper part
burns more brightly. And this difference seems to
result from the different state of the sulphureous
particles. Now then, since the sulphureous particles.
carried through the flame get smaller during the
whole course of their passage and are therefore to-
some extent consumed‚ the fiame must gradually

become smaller and end at last, as it does, in a
pornt.
