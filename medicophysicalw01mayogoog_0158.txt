CHAPTER XI

OF THE AERJAL VORTEX, OR ASCENT OF SEA-
WATER. Anglice: A SPOUT

Sumne that we have treated of the elastic power of air
andos its motion, let me be permitted to submit here
'some observations regarding the wonderful pheno·
menon familiar to sailors, which is in English called
a Spout ; that, namely, in which a huge mass of water
rises up on high like a pillar, and besides a whirlpool
oi water> is carried alost. For I think that that pheno-
menon is caused by awhirling movement of the air
and by a diminution of its elastic force and pressure.
For Ι cannot agree with those who maintain that an
ascent of water such as this, arises solely from the
circumgyration of the water, as though on being
driven into a circle, whether by winds rushing from
opposite points or in any other way, it were thrust
on high at the centre of its vortex. For it is scarcely
credible that from this cause water could be raised to
so great a height as in the aforementioned pheno·
menon, since there is nothing to hinder water raised
above the surface in that manner from soon flowing
over to the sides. But indeed it has been ascertained
by experiment that water, when made to rotate, rather
⁴falls downwards at the middle of its vortex than
-ascends in that way.

But in order that the reason of the phenomenon
may be known, I have thought it desirable to present
a representation of it, as it was delineated by a elever
sailor who had much experience of these things,
in Plate VI„ Fig. 1. In this figure:
