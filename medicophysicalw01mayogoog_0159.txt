Iao Mayoro

a, a, is the huge mass of sea-water rising up like a
pillar or a mountain. This mass is sometimes of
greater, sometimes of less height, and assumes some·
times a pyramidal and occasionally an orbicular form.

c, c, is a somewhat dense fog produced by the
ascent of fine water particles. This, which derives
its origin from the aforementioned mass oi water,
expands in all directions, but it soon begins to con·
tract gradually, and at· last ends in a point at e, e.

e, c, f,s, is a gloomy tube which, descending from
an overhanging cloud, directly overtops the afore·
said column ol water. This tube is at first like a
stream of smoke‚ which seems to descend gradually,
yet so as to leave a gap between its lower end and the
underlying water. Further, this tube is after a short
time filled with a whirling mass ol vapours densely
crowded together, or it may be of water, which
rushes upwards with a most furious motion, with
spiral revolution, and a remarkable roaring noise, as
is shown in the aforesaid figure. Alter about ten
minutes, a part of the tube, a third say, or a hall, is
osten broken off, and when this happens, the waters
rush down in immense quantity—a fearlul sight to
behold—and ships are sometimes sunk by thern.

d, d, is the cloud from which the said tube is seen
to descend. It is at its first appearance small and
thin, but it soon expands widely in all directions, and
at last, when it has become exceedingly dense and -
gloomy, it dissolves in a violent storm of rain. So
much then by way of description ol the phenomenon.
It now remains for me to show next the way in which
itis produced bya whirling movement os the air
and by lts diminished pressure.

And here in the first place 1 take it for granted
tltrt tlte air is sometimes driven round in a circle,
