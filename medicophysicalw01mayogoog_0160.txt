whether as the result of winds rushing from opposite
directions, and at length dashed against each other
and bent into a circular path, or as the result os their
being suddenly thrown back by the resistance of lolty
mountains or ol dense clouds, or in the manner
indicated in the previous chapter.

2, It is to be observed that aerial particles when
revolving in a circle, try to recede from the centre of
their motion, as was observed long ago by Descartes.
Hence if we suppose that a cylindrical column of air,
reaching lrorn the summit of the atmosphere to the
water beneath, is made to rotate, and if that a'e‘rial
vortex is large enough and is carried round with a
very rapid rotation, the total force by which all the
particles ol that aerial vortex strive to depart from the
centre of their motion will be great enough to resist
the pressure ol the surrounding air and even to over·
come it. But if this happens, and the aerial particles
recede from the centre ol the vortex, the middle of it
will be like an empty tube: for the case will be
exactly like that in which a large number of globules
are placed in a concave circular vessel and made to
rotate rapidly with it, when you will see these globules
go away from the centre of the cavity and describe
their circular orbits at its side.

But now when a vacuum is made in this way in
the middle of the air-vortex, the water which lies
beneath will be forced to ascend by atmospheric
pressure, just as it would be into a vacuous tube.
Nay‚ although the aerial cylinder may not rotate with
so swift a motion as is needed for completely over-

coming the pressure of the surrounding air and pro-
ducing a vacuum in the middle ol the vortex, still, with
however feeble force it rotates, the weight and pres·
sure of the air will certainly diminish gradually from
