the outer edge of the vortex to its contre. For let
a, a, b, b, iu the aforesaid figure be the aerial cylinder
eextending from the summit of the atmosphere to the
subjacent water. While as yet it was not in rotation,
'the pressure of the air of which it was composed is
certainly quite equal to that of the atmosphere, since
‘their weights were in equilibrium ς but now when the
aerial cylinder is made to revolve, the force with which
each particle in rotation strives to recede from the
-centre of its motion is added to the original pressure
-of the cylinder. Hence it is that these forces in union
will preponderate over the pressure of the surrounding
atmosphere, and therefore the adjoining air will be
pushed out by the revolving air, and will necessarily
recede somewhat, say from a to i, and from b to g, and
‘consequently the rotated air following it will spread
out into a larger space than before and constitute the
cylinder τ’, i, g, g. Hence the rotated airis not a little
rarefied, and consequently the water beneath is less
pressed by it than before.

That the pressure of the rotated air gradually
diminishes from the outer edge to the centre of the
vortex, 1 gather from the following. For when all
the particles of the atirial whirlpool strive to recede
from the centre, it results that they impel and press
against the particles of air adjacent to them on the
-outside; while, on the contrary, the air between them
and the centre of the vortex is subjected to less pres-
sure from them now than while as yet they had no
circular motion and no tendency to recede from the
-centre of their motion. But since the rotated air, in
proportion to its nearness to the centre of the vortex,
suffers less pressure, it follows that the air particles,
the further they are within, expand and rarefy the
imre, by virtue of their elastic force, and conse·
