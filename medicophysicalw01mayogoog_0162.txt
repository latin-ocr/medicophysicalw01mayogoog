quently press less on the water which lies under them.
Whence it is that the water rises gradually from the

inner edge' to the centre of the vortex, the water
rising more in that part of the vortex where the
rotation is more rapid, as is shown in the figure.
Iremark here that it is probable that at the base
of the mass of rising water, the water, as shown in the
figure, is somewhat depressed (although this, perhaps,
ca'n scarcely be seen by sailors at a distance). For
when the air surrounding the first cylinder, a, a, b, b, ·
is thrust from a to iand from b to g, in the manner

- aforesaid, the result is that the air at τ’ and g, being

much compressed, undergoes considerable condensa·
tion, and in consequence the water beneath will be
somewhat depressed by the greater weight than usual
of superincumbent air.

With regard to the fog that rests upon the pile ol
waters,l think it is caused in this way. Thus since
, the air about the surface of the rising water rotates
very rapidly‚ the water, at the outer parts at least, is
carried round along with the air; whence it comes
about that small particles of the water, receding from
the centre of their motion, are dispersed in all direc-
tions and borne upwards, just as would happen ifa top
with its upper surface spherical were wetted with
water and made to spin.

But the reason why those vapours‚ as shown in
the figure, are bent and at last unite in the torrent at
e, e, seems to be this, that the nearer the rotated air
is to the centre of the aerial vortex the more it is
rarefied and thinned, as has already been shown. For
hence it is that while the aqueous particles driven away
from the aforesaid mass are carried upwards and out-
wards, they are at every instant of their progress bent
inwards by the air, which gradually becomes denser
