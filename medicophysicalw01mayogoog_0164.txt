On Sol Nitrum and Miro-Atrum Spr'rit 131

follow them, it comes to pass that vapours are
carried in a continuous stream towards the centre of
the vortex.

About the said tube, it is noteworthy that at first,
when, namely, the whirl of vapours is not yet observed
in it, it looks like a rather thin smoke and also gradu-
ally descende, while yet it would seem that the vapours
eutering its lower eud would cause it to be seen there
first. I think the reason of these things is that when
the air first began its rotating movement‚ only afew
rather thiu vapours—those, namely, which, already in
the atmosphere, were carried upwards—had entered
·the said tube. And these are first seen at the top of
the tube because they are assembled there in greater
·abundance‚and are alsosomewhat condensed on account
of theirdimiuished velocity. However‚ I do not know
whether or not these things depend also on another
cause, for, since the air receding from the middle of the
vortex leaves the tube there nearly vacuous, the aerial
·particles, and there are but few remaining in it, will
as they expand‚ appear under the form of smoke, not
otherwise than it happens in a glass vessel when the air
is being exhausted by Boyle’s pump, as will be explained
more fully elsewhere. Audit seems to be forthis reason
‘that the smoky tube is first seen high in the air, where
the force by which the rotated air strives to recede
from the centre of its motion first takes effect and
produces a vacuum, as has already been shown.

Itis besides to be noted that the nearer to the
water the said tube descends‚ the higher does the water
underneath rise. And the reason of this seems to be
·that a long descending tube cannot be formed unless
there is a very swilt whirl of the air, and the ascent
· of the water depen ds on this.

When the vapours driven up in the said tube have
