come to the top of the aerial vortex, they, receding
from the centre of their spiral motion, are dispersed all
around, and, heaped up in great abundance, form the
dense and gloomy cloud widely spread for a short time
(d, d). This, after the motion of the vapours of which
it consists has ceased, breaks up in a storm of rain, and,
pressing by its weight on the underlying air and push-
ing it out, causes the violent wind. But it is to be
observed that although at some distance from the
aforesaid mass of waters, boisterous winds blow and
the sea is very rough, yet near the phenomenon all is
calm, which l think may thus be explained. Since the:
air is very dense at the outer edge of the vortex, as is
seen in the figure, and is thrust out all round from the
adrial vortex by the pressure of the superincumbent
cloud, the winds carried towards the vortex are arrested
and turned back by the air, which is very dense and also
rushes in the opposite direction, so that their impulse
cannot reach the vortex, yet meanwhile these winds
driven backwards cause furious whirlwinds at some·
distance from the said phenomenon.

It also makes for this, that the sea near the column
of rising water is whirled round-a motion in water
very much opposed to the propagation of waveS, which
advance only in straight lines.

After the mass of water has again fallen‚a certain
part of the said tube is usually broken off, and when
this happens avast quantity of water descends from on
high, and if a ship happens to be under it she is in-
stantly overwhelmed and sunk. There can be no
doubt that the water is produced by the condensation

' · and collection of the vapours which have risen in the·

tube. But such a heaping up of them comes from this
that when the motion of the adria] whirlwind has
abated, the vapours at the top of the tube, ceasing
