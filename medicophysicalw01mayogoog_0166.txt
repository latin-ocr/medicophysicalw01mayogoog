from their motion and, being condensed into water,
are carried down and encounter others which are still
ascending at the bottom of the tube, and at last fall
down along with them. ’ ,

But here we must ask why, on the cessation of ¹the

circular motion ol the air, the elevated vapours presently
fall 3 because, although the motion of the air by whirl-
ing the water underneath was the cause of itsvfine
particles being carried up, yet, after these vapours have
been once set in motion, the whirling motion of the air
seems to contribute nothing to their ascent, unless
perchance the air is reflected upwards by the water
underneath.

In regard to this, it is probable that when the
circular motion of the air gradually abates, the
aqueous particles do not, as before, leave the aforesaid
mass of water with a force intense enough to raise
them as high as the summit of the atmosphere, and
therefore these vapours must be heaped up in the
manner already described, and rush downwards ; while
yet, if the whirling motion of the air has suddenly
ceased, the vapours, violently agitated, ascend beyond
the top of the tube and are dispersed there, so that
the tube (as is sometimes the case) will seem to
ascend aloft. To this Ι add further, that so long as
the circular motion of the air continues, the pressure
of the atmosphere contributes somewhat to drive the
vapours upwards into the tube, as was previously said.

About the said phenomenon we remark in fine that
if it should happen that the aforesaid tube rise right·
above an island or sea-coast, its lower end will be
driven back from the island or coast, sea-wards, as is
delineated in Plate VI., Fig. 2. But that the reason
of this may be understood, let a, a, bea section of the
