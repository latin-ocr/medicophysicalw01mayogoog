in the figure. For the air near the island, rotated from
b towards d, when it has reached the island at c, can
advarlce no further in that circle ; since therefore the·
rotating air is pressed also by the external air adjacent
to it (and this, as has been already pointed out, is
much condensed), it will necessarily be reflected
towards e, where on meeting the air that has been
carried from b towards d, it forces it outwards and
is turned round along with it towards f. And εο, the
first vortex being interrupted‚ a new vortex, e, s,
emerges, in the centre of which the column of water·
rises, as is shown in the same figure. But that new
vortex coming, at some height above the sea, say at
i, against the former vortex which is rotating with
the opposite motion, is by it, as being the more
powerful, gradually turned back, so that both
ultimately coincide at a, a.

OF LIGHT AND COLOURS

WE have already treated of nitro-a'e'rial spirit so far as
lire is kindled by it 3 it remains for us to subjoin some

offspring of fire. With regard to rays of light, it can
scarcely be believed that certain effluvia of more
delicate flame, shot out from the luminous body,
reach the beholder's eye. For who can imagine that
any fiery corpuscles can be brought, almost in a
moment, from the sun to the earth? Much less is
it probable that fiery particles· emanate from a small
