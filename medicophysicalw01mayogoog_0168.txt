lamp in quantity sufficient to illuminate the region
round about. Nor again is it to be thought that
finer sulphureous particles, flying away far from the
original blaze, excite other (nitro-aerial) particles for

the kindling as it were. of a very meagre fiame,
namely Light, as the distinguished Willis and others
have supposed. For if such were the case, why should
the light not endure for a little after the extinction
of the lamp? For it seems to me that the sul-
phureous particles proceeding from the lamp just
before its extinction, would continue to produce light
until they arrived at the extreme limit of the illumi-
nated region, for the sulphureous particles which
emanate from any burning body do not resign their
fiery nature until they have ascended to the furthest
limits of the flame. Hence the flame of a lamp
usually continues fora short time after its sulphureous
matter has been entirely consumed, as was shown
above. Yet since the sphere of the blaze is but small
and the fiery particles pass through it inan instant,
hence it is that the flame quickly expires. ·As,
however, the sphere of light is much wider, it would
seem that the luminous particles cannot pass through
it so quickly but that the light should continue for
some time after the lamp has been removed or
extinguished. Further, if light were a somewhat
finer flame, what should prevent it from being
deflected hither and thither by blasts of wind like
dame, in proportion to its consistence, such as that
may be? And how, lastly, could rays of light be
transmitted instantaneously through the most solid
bodies such as glass, if light were propagated by means
of sulphureous particles? For even the extremely
small and nimble nitro-aerial particles do not pene·
trate bodies so solid, without some interval of time,
