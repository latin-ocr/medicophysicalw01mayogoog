On Sal Nitrum and Nr'tro-Ae'rz'al spirit 137

place deprived of air there are nitro-aerial particles,
and that the fire produced there by the solar rayS, con-
centrated by means of a speculum, consists in this,
that the nitro-aerial particles are so much impelled
>at the point where the solar rays meet that they
are thrown into a really fiery motion. So that the
’ medium by whose impulse the rays ol light are propa-
,gated se'ems clearly to be nothing else than nitro·
aerial particles very dcusely distributed through the
atmosphere. Iudeed it is probable that nitro-aerial
particles when moving in a luminous body witha
very rapid and fiery motion, communicate to the
other nitro-aerial particles, dispersed through the
ether and of the same nature as themselves, the
peculiar impulse by which the rays of light are
propagated.

But you will say, if uitro-a'e'rial particles exist in a
place void of air, why cannot a lamp be kindled and
'burn there since no requisite is lacking for the pro·
duction of flame. 1 answer that the sulphureous
particles of a lamp contribute in no way to produce
flame, except in so far as they strike out from aerial
particles, the nitro-aerial particles which‚sundered with
violence, are thrown into fiery motion, as was pointed
out above. But sulphureous matter seems to be by
‘no means fir for throwing into fiery motion the nitro-
:ae'rial particles disseminated through the ether.

Like igneous particles, so also moving particles of all
substances whatsoevcr which give an impulse to the
luminous medium in the duc way, are capable of pro·
ducing light. Hence it is that a kind of feeble light is
emitted by the glow-worm, by rotten wood‚ and the
like.

Further that light is propagated by the impulse of
nitro-aerial particles seems to he confirmed by its pass·
