ing with greater ease through such bodies as are ex·
tremely rigid and crammed with nitro-aerial particles
—glass‚ for instance, and similar substances, but above
all‚‘ aerial particles whose rigidity is due to nitro-a'e'rial
particles densely infixed in them, as I previously·
endeavoured to show. ’ ·

Here too we can appeal to an experiment re·-
ferred to by the Hon. Robert Boyle; to wit, when
air is suddenly pumped from a glass vessel, the glass·
soon becomes dark inside and seems to be filled with
nebulous fumes, and besides light, or rather a certain
momentary whiteness, is sometimes produced in it.
This Ι think is to be accounted lor by the immediate·
expansion of the residuary particles of air, when the·
greater part of the air is pumped from the glass ; not.
otherwise than as steel springs which have been bent.
round coil upon coil, open out in a moment as soon
as the force by which they were bent is with--
drawn. But when aerial particles extend themelves in
this way, their structure changes at each successive
moment in which the movement of recoil takes place„
(as is evident from what has been said on the subject
of elasticity); whence it is that the rays of light are
somewhat interrupted‚ for, hemely, the nitro-aerial
particles infixed in the aerial particles, by whose im·-
pulse moreover light is transmitted‚ move with a.
motion different from that by which the action of light
is propagated ; so that the aerial particles cannot now
transmit the impulse of light as they would otherwise>
do, but reflect it in the manner of a mirror. But as
soon as the aerial particles cease from their motion of'
recoil, the glass becomes again pellucid.
