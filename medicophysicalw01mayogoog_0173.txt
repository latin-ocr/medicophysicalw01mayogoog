140 Mayow

if the 'aforesaid plane were extremely smooth, so that
all'therays falling upon it were'reflected towards c,
the plane could not be seen at all by an eye situated
at a, so that it appears that an image of the· plane is
propagated by certain rays reflected to the eye. But ’
this answer seems unsatisfactory, for if the rays of Ι

light falling upon the said plane were reflected in
that manner in every direction, then almost the whole
chamber would be illuminated by reflected rayS, just
as the chamber at c will be lighted up if the said plane
is polished and capable of reflecting the rays of light.
For since we suppose the plane to appear white, the
rays of light ought to be reflected all round in no small
amount, for white is supposed to be produced only
when the rays of light are very densely reflected. But
in fact, although the said plane is seen as white hythe
aforesaid eye, yet the eye will be all the while in dark-
ness, and will not be able to discern what is nearest
to it. And yet if the eye were placed at c, where,
namely, the rays reflected from the polished surface
tend, it would be dazzled with light and would see
everything near it illuminated by reflected light.
Besides it would follow from this hypothesis that the
rays of light so reflected from any white surface are
more dense than those which emanate from fire or any
flame of a red or less white colour. For it is supposed
that the intermediate colours, such as red and others
of that kind, are produced by light and darkness
variously intermixed, while white results from light
when most densely reflected. But this is by no means
the case3 for ifa reddish fire, such as that of burning
coals, were kindled in the said chamber, the whole
chamber would be illuminated by its rays, while the
colour white is propagated with scarcely a trace of light.
Still I would not deny that a white surface reflecte
