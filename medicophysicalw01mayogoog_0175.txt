to them, and, by tickling them, cause sneezing. But
luminous particles seem to propagate the image of

themselves by the very gentle impulse of a peculiar
⁴ extremely fine medium. And this when conveyed
bya continuous undulation of the medium of vision
*to the eye, and by means of it to the delicate origin
of the optic nerves‚ impresses on them such strokes
-as are appointed by nature for producing the image
and the perception of light. Nor is it necessary for
the perception of light and colours, as the very acute
Descartes pointed out long ag0, that a material image
resembling the ideas which we form in our minds of
objects, should pass from them to the eye, since in·
-deed, to produce the different sense perceptions in the
mind it is only necessary that the fine nerve threads
which proceed from the brain should be agitated with
various motions. For in this waya blind man who
uses a stick to guide his steps, feels and distinguishes
well enough,'by -the various ways in which the stick is
moved when it strikes against bodies of all sorts,
whether it is a tree,·or a stone, or anylhing else that
opposes him.
· As the likeness of a luminous body, so also the
image and visible form of an illuminated body appear
to be propagated by the motion of a special medium
distinct from the action of light. For when the afore-
mentioned plane, exposed to the rays of light, is seen
by an eye placed in darkness, its visible form is· con-
veyed to the eye not by reflected rays of light, since
’ these do not reach the eye,¹ but by the motion of a
peculiar medium quite different from the action of light.
But the mode in which this special medium is moved¹
will be treated of later.

As to the medium by whose impulse the likenesses ·
of things are propagated, it is probable that it consists
