a certain new motion, by which the medium of vision
is struck with an impulse distinct from the action of
light. For we notice that the rays of light do not,
likeigneousparticles, spread their image in all directions
around. F or when the rays of light pass through the
aforesaid chamber, they are seen only by an eye which
directly faces them but not, as we showed above, by
an eye situated at the side. Whence we may infer
that nitro-aerial particles in a burning body are some·
how driven round in a circle, and in their circular
motion strike the medium of vision all round, but that
the luminous particles move only in straight lines, so
that, whether by very frequent blows or by a kind of
pressure, they impel the visible medium directly
forward only, but not to the side. And indeed the
action of light tends to move straight forward, pre·
cisely as if it were projected in a straight line 3 for the
rays of light, when they strike upon a plane, are re·
flected lilre a solid body at an angle of reflection equal
to the angle of incidence. But when luminous par·
ticles impinge on an illuminated body they probably
acquire a new tremulous motion and are moved with
very short and frequent vibrations, precisely as happens
to a dart when it is thrown and one end of it strikes
a solid body. Hence it is that the medium of vision is
struck by the vibration of luminous particles even on
the sides and in all directions. But since this sort of
vibration of the luminous corpuscles varies according to
the diversityin the surface of the illuminated bodies,and
since,in fine, the mediumofvision is differentlyimpelled
by it, hence it is that the diverse perceptions of colours
and of images are produced and propagated all round.
With respect to the glittering white colour which
a brightly shining lamp shows, it seems to depend on
this, that the particles of the shining body, agitated
