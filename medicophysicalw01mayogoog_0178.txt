with the swiftest motion, and in deusest array, strike
with vivid action the very subtle medium of vision in
individual points, with no interruptim, and by this,
transmitted to the eye, the perception of light is
caused. Moreover the variation of this glittering
whiteness results from the interruption of the impulse
of the very subtle medium at certain points by opaque
bodies interspersed in the medium.

The white colour, which most nearly approaches
glittering white in brightness, does not seem to
depend, as is commonly supposed, on an extremely
dense reflection of the rays of light. For, as Ι have
endeavoured to‘show, all colours are different from
the action of light.

It seems, therefore, that we should maintain that
the white colour arises from this, that the luminous
particles impinging on the illuminated surface, en·
counter in its very many points such a resistance that
these particles are, in consequence, excited to some
new tremulous motion with very frequent vibrations,
as we have just shown. And by these very
numerous particles, made to vibrate in this manner,
the medium of vision is struck very frequently and at
very many points with an impulse different from
light; and in this way the white colour seems to be
produced. And hence, since a white surface has
usually many very minute excrescences distributed
thickly over it-not that these reflect the rays of
light (for rays of light are scarcely reflected at all
from a white surface such as paper, but on the
contrary the impulse of light is quite destroyed by it,
as was shown above) but so far as the very numerous
luminous particles falling on these molecules acquire a
certain new vibration by which the very subtle medium
of vision is struck in very many places-the white
