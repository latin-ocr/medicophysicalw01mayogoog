colour is propagated. But on the other hand if the
rays of light are entirely absorbed, without resistance‚
by the surface of the illuminated body, or if the solid
body is of such a kind as offers ¹little resistance to
luminous motion, black colour or rather the absence
of all colour is the result. For example, if an eye
situated in darkness is turned towards an illuminated
mirror, but in such a position that the rays falling on
the mirror are not reflected to the eye, the mirror will
appear of a black colom, or rather it will scarcely be
seen at all. Nay, although the mirror be so placed
that the rays of light reflected from it fall upon the
eye of the beholder, the rays will indeed flash like
’ lightning upon the eye. but the glass itself will
scarcely be seen at all. No doubt the luminous
particles impinging on the mirror, throw the nitro-
aerial particles which the glass contains-and which
are kindred with themselves—into their own
luminous motion, for it has elsewhere been shown
’ that very solid bodies, such as glass and the like,
have nitro-aerial particles inserted in them. But
since the particles of the glass yield to the motion of
the luminous particles and in no way resistit, these
luminous particles will acquire none ol that motion of
vibration by which colours and the images of things
are propagated; hence it is that glass ol that kind
has no colour at all.

As to red and the other colours which differ from

the glittering white, they seem to be due to various
mixtures of the glittering white with darkness.

From what hasbeen said, we must seek for an
explanation why substances ofa white colour can
scarcely be kindled by solar rays collected by a
burning-glasS‚ while, on the other hand, such as are
black easily take fire. For when nitro-aerial and
