luminous particles, impinging on a white surface,
acquire the new motion by which the white colour
is propagated, they lose entirely their luminous and
fiery impulse: but it is otherwise when they fall on
a black surface. Δ ’

Finally, we note also here that the impulses ol light
and of colours follow almost the same laws 3 for colours
aud images of things (although they are propagated
'laterally and in all directions, as was shown above)
proceed, like the rays ol light, only in straight lines,
and further, like light, they undergo reflection and
refraction.

CHAPTER XIII

OF LIGHTNING

Havnuo now treated of fire and light, let me add a
lew remarks on lightning, since it seems to waver
between fiame and light. ¹

In the first place thenas to lightning, it is not to
be supposed that any flame discharged from a flashing
cloud reaches the eye. For who can conceive a flame
so vast and swilt as to spread in a moment over .
almost the whole hemisphere. Nor can it be said that
the sulphureous exhalations which are raised by the
sun’s heat and widely dispersed through the atmo-
sphere are all kindled together by the flame ol the
flashing cloud, for if it were so these sulphureous
exhalations, when once kindled, would burn till they
were totally consumed; and, consequently, since the
sulphureous particles would be used up the first time,
