148 Mayow

there would be no second flash. And indeed the
flash would continue for some time ; but the opposite
is the case. .

Should any one here say that the sulphureous ex-
halations, which are imprisoned here and there among
the clouds, are separately kindled in consequence·
of their being violently agitated, and that the flash of'
lightning is due to the wide expansion of their light ς.
Ι reply that it is scarcely probable that a fire so im-
mense as to be capable ol propagating light to such
vast distances, is produced by a succession of separate
flashes‚ for it is to be noted that lightning is not
only seen at a distance, but reaches to the eye of the
spectator. Further, if lightning were nothing else
than rays of light, how does it happen that it not in·
frequently sets fire to things which it meets? For this
is never done, even by the solar rays, except when
collected by a burning-glass. And from what source
finally should the power corne, which is required for
the effects usually produced by lightning, if it consisted
merely of light? .

Iconless for my part that sulphureous exhalations
disseminated through the air are not infrequently
kindled by lightning, but the flame produced by their
burning is quite different from a flash of lightning,
and is propagated hither and thither i'n a skirmishing·
way, as it is led by the exhalations, and it also lasts·
lor some time. Such a flame is sometimes seen in a
very intense flash.

But that it may be understood what I think about
lightning, it is allowable for us to assume that thunder-
storms are caused by this, that the clouds high up
in the atmosphere, when condensed and frozen, descend
on those beneath with a violent crash, as has been
shown by the very ingenious Descartes. Further,
