On Sal ltsz'trum and Μ’ΐιυ-Αὲηὶιῖ spirit 149 ·

when the clouds dash violently against one another

in this way, the air around is necessarily ¹thrown into
a tremulous motion; and this agitation ol the air is
conveyed, 'with scarcely any loss of time, to a ‘great
distance, on account of the continuity of the atmo-
sphere. Nay, in whatever manner thunderstorms are
produced, the air must certainly be agitated with a
very great commotion.

Now Ι certainly think it is probable that the aerial '
particles, since they are solid and rigid, strike lorcibly
against each other in consequence of the violent
concussion of the air produced in a thunderstorm‚
and that they wear themselves by the powerful and
sudden mutual shock. The consequence is, that the
nitro-a'e'rial particles, struck out from the aerial particles
and thrown into a fiery motion, produce a certain light
and momentary flame (such as that of lightning is)
which extends over nearly the whole hemisphere.
For it is very much as though an immense congeries
of very small flints were struck with so violent a blow
that an almost infinite number of sparks of fire should
he struck out from the collision ol its innumerable
particles; for 1n this case a certain light flame, pro-
pagated through the whole aggregate 0 ffiints, would
be suddenly kindled. Besides l do not know whether
or not the nitro· εὸτία] particles disseminated among
the aerial particles (from some sort ol impulse ol
which, I assume that light arises) can be thrown by
the violent concussion ol the atmosphere into such
a motion as is requisite for the production of light.
And indeed if lightning were light and nothing
more, it would seem to be due sometimes to this
cause.

As to the fervent and very intense sultriness, which
often precedes thunderstorms, it must not be thought
