that it results from sulphureous exhalations. carried
alost and dispersed through the air, for that kind of
sulphureous matter can only become heated, or con-
tribute to the production of heat, by first being kindled.
Thereiore 1 think it should be held that the said
sultriness is not infrequently the result of a tremulous
and unequal movement of the air; for the air, when

agitated by a motion of that kind, becomes very warni

as the distinguished Descartes has remarked. For if
any one blows vigorously against the back oi the hand

the breath is felt to be very cold ;.while, on the cona

trary, if he blows it into the contracted and bent palm

of the hand, it becomes not a little warni ;r the reason

seems to be that when the abrial particles are thrown

into a tremulous motion by being reflected hither and

thither in the hollow hand, it happens that the nitro-

aerial particles, by their striking against each other,

are gentlydetached andthrown into the motion that is

required for heat. But if a considerable tract of air is

at any time agitated by such a motion, it will not only

grow warm but will also be in a condition for entering

upon a motion of the kind required for the production ,
of lightning.

As regards the wonderful violence with which
lightning sometimes overthrows and burns whatever
stands in its way, the distinguished Gassendi very in·
geniously supposes that glomeres (as he calls thern)
consisting of nitrous, vitriolic, and sulphureous ex-
halations, together with a small portion of cloud
gathered round them, descend to the earth, and that,
when they take fire at last, they burst into a very im·
petuous flante and destroy everything they come near.
But, indeed, not to say that nitrous or vitriolic vapours
do not exist in the air (ajsIendeavoured to show above),
*it is scarcely probable that a small portion of cloud (if
