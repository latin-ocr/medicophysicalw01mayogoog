directed are so agitated that the nitro-adria]- particles
which they contain (for we have shown elsewhere
that rigid bodies such as iton, abound in nitro-
a'e'rial particles) are greatly disturbed and thrown into
a fiery motion, and in consequence of this movement
of the particles the structure of the substances in
which they reside is destroyed. And the more solid
bodies ure, and the more theyabound in nitro-adrial
penicles, the more quickly are they consumed when
struck by lightning3 for the particles of the more
solid body strike more violently against one another,
and agitate themselves the more. Hence it is that
the iron is melted by lightning while the scabbard, on
account of its loose texture and the want of nitro-aerial
particles‚ remains uninjured. Thus the very strength
of bodies tends sometimes to their destruction and the
strongest things perish the sooner from internal dis·
cords aud movements.

lt is also noteworthy that animals are often killed by
lightning without showing any trace of a blow. This
seems to be due to the fact that aerial particles—not
those alone which are disseminated through the air,
but those also which exist in the mass of the blood-
are thrown by the violent concussion ol the air into a
kind of dash, in consequence of which they immedi-
ately become effete and altogether unsuitable ior
keeping up the fermentation of the blood. To this I
add that the animal spirits are also dissipated by
lightning, as will be shown elsewhere.

Lastly‚ with regard to the impetuous and whirling
winds which usually accompany thunderstorms‚ they
seem to be caused not merely by the air being .
violently thrust forth by the pressure of the descend·
ing cloud, but als0‚ to some extent, in consequence of a
vast tract of air being deprived of its elastic force and
