pressure, whether owing to the nitro-aerial and elastic
particles struck out of the aerial particles colliding with
each other in thunder, or on account of sulphureous
‚exhalations kindled hereand there throughout the
air, for aerial particles when deprived of nitro-,aerial
particleS, whether by combustion or in any other way,
lose their elasticity, as was previously pointed out.
Hence it is that the air, rushing from every quarter‚ is
borne with rapid motion to that place where the
pressure of the air is diminished. But these a'e'rial
torrents rushing from opposite points produce, in their
passage, a sudden and impetuous wind, and when at
last they meet and dash against each other they are
bent in all directions and driven round in acircle,
since the air rushes from all directions and allows no
outlet for their escape, and this seems to be the
cause of the violent whirlwinds which suddenly arise.

CHAPTER XIV

OF THE HEAT OF QUICKLIME. INCIDENTALLV'OF
THE COMBINA TION OF OPPOSITE SAlTS

Now that we have discussed nitro-aerial spirit in so
far as it is the cause of fire and heat, it will not be out
of keeping with our plan to treat ol quicklime, in
which, when it is sprinkled with water, nitro-aerial
and igneous particles manifest themselves with very
intense heat. With regard to the heat ol quicklime,
the learned Willis has maintained. in his treatise on
Fermentation that in consequence of ' the long-con-
tinued calcination of the calcareous stone, igneous
