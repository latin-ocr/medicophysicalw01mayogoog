effervescence of its aeid salt with the fixed salt of the
lime.

Further‚ common sulphur, boiled in 'the water in

which quicklime has been slaked, will dissolve exactly
as it would in a liquid imbued with an alkaline salt.
However‚ if spirit of vitriol or any aeid liquid be
poured into the solution, the sulphur will at once be
precipitated with a fetid smell; so that it is certainly
established that the solution of sulphur in the water ·
in which quicklime has been slaked, is due to its
alkaline salt, ior otherwise the sulphur would not be
precipitated from that water when aeid liquids are
poured into it.
' To this Ι further add that if quicklime be put intoa
solution of sal armoniae, whatever of aeid there is in
the sal armoniae will be absorbed by the fixed salt of
the lime, while the volatile sal armoniae, liberated
from the saline fetterS, passes meanwhile into vapours,
just as if fixed saltos tartar had been mixed with the·
sal armoniae. Now all these things clearly prove
that quicklime and the water in which it has been
slaked are impregnated with a fixed salt; and this
we may see for ourselves, for it is certain from common
observation that an alkaline salt, or at least a nitrous
salt partly composed of an alkali, exudes from walls
which have been recently whitewashed and adheres
to them.

Further‚ the existence of acid salt in lime may be

inierred from what follows. For if a solution of any
fixed salt be mixed with the water of quicklime, pre·
cipitation will immediately take place and the water
will become milky‚ which would not, however, happen
unless that water were imbued with some aeid salt.
Resides, the water of quicklime poured upon any
„volatile salt fixes it and changes it into an insoluble
