lime, as was observed by the learned Zwelfer. But it
is well enough known that volatile salts are not ,fixed
or changed in that manner except by an aeid salt.
. Further‚ if water which has slaked quicklime be
poured copiously into boiled milk, the milk will soon be
curdled, just as if an aeid liquid had been mixed with it.

From what has been said, it is evident Ι think that
contrary salts lie hidden in lime, as may also be
inferred from the very contexture of slaked lime. For
whenever contrary salts in their encounter lay hold of
any third matter, there is formed from the close
combination of all a neutral body which is quite
insipid, like terra damnata, and altogether insoluble
in water. Of this sort are nearly all the Magisteries‚
such as those of hartshorn, of coral, and the like.¹ Nor
does slaked lime seem to be anything but a Magistery
formed by a union of contrary salts with a stony earth.
lndeed if salt of tartar be mixed with a solution of
alum, a tertium quid will be formed that is somewhat
sweet and astringent to the taste and not very different
from lime, so that it 'is not at all wonderful that an
alkali, pure and unmixed, is not drawn out from
¹ quicklime by pouring water upon it ; for its contrary
salts act on each other when water is poured on it
and are turned into a neutral body. But since the
acid salt of the lime is not united firmly to the fixed
salt, as will be shown below, the fixed salt extricates
. itself in the course of time from the letters of the
acid salt and at last, thrust from the structure of the
lime, adheres to the whitewashed walls.

We notice, lastly, here, in support of the foregoing,
that quicklime will-not become warin if sprinkled with
highly rectified spirit of wine, or spirit of turpentine,
or with other liquids of that kind. And the reason
seems to be that spirit of wine' and liquids of that
