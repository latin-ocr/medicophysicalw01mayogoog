sort, abounding in volatile sulphur, are quite in·
capable of dissolving fixed salts, so that neither can
the alkaline salt of quicklime be dissolved by them,
and yet this is an indispensable condition of the
productiori of beat in lime, as will be shown later.
So that it is abundantly clear that the heat of quick-
lime is not, as is commonly supposed, produced by the
igneous particles which are simply fixed in it, being
thrown‚ at last, into vigorous motion by the humidity
which is antagonistic to them, but by the liberation
and effervescence of its salts; inasmuch as quicklime
does not become hot when moistened by any liquid
indiscriminately, but only by such as are fitted lor
speedily dissolving its salts. Nay, the liquids which,
in consequence of abounding in volatile sulphur, are
best adapted to set igneous particles in motion and
produce heat, when poured on quicklime produce no
heat in it, although, on the other hand, the same lime
becomes very hot when sprinkled with aqueous fluids,
the chief extinguishers ol fire and heat. But this can
result from no other cause than the fitness of the
latter, but not ol the former, liquids to dissolve its
salts.

· · It remains now to inquire whence these different

·   ,εεΙζεωὶ lime trace their descent. In the first place,
· ’ · · then, with respect to the origin of the fixed salt, it is

generated in the same way as in earth. For as the
seeds ol fixed salts lie hidden in the earth's bosom, as
was elsewhere shown, so t00, they may be found in
shells, chalk, and stones; and thebproof of this is that
most of these effervesce with any aeid spirit poured
upon them.

As regards the origin ol the acid salt of quicklime,
we must believe that it is made by the action of
nitro-aerial and igneous particles during the long
