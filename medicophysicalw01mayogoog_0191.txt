calcination ol the olcareons stone. Foras the aeid
spirit ol sulphur is produced [rom the more fixed par·
ticles ol eommou sulphur, also the spirits ol vitriol and
ol nitre from metallic or earthy sulphur, by the action
ol nitro-aerial and igneous spirit. as I hare before
attempted to show, so it is likely that the nitroafirial
particles ol fire encouuter, in the course of the long-
oontinued calcination ol the mlmreons stone, the more
fixed particles ol the sulphur of the stone (lor ‹al-
careous stone, like hints, contains much sulphur), and
rub and sharpen them, and at last convert thern into
an aeid salt in the manner described above.

Let us see next how it is that contrary salte-aeid,
to wit, and alkali—subsist together in quicklime and
yet do not act upon each other until water is poured
on the lime. As regards this, it is probable that the
aeid spirit of quicklime becomes so sharp and liery in
consequence ol its long calcination‚ as to be altogether
unfit for engaging with fixed salts until its more
powerlul igneous force is diluted by admixture with
water and to some extent moderated; for saline
solvents are sometimes so corrosive that they fail to
dissolve or in any way affect metals, which in their
nature closely resemble fixed salts‚ till their too keen
soree is diminished by admixture ol water.

Further‚ the fixed, like the aeid, salt of the quick-
lime becomes in the highest degree biting and fiery
by reason of the fiery particles infixed ln it during
its long calcination. For it is to be noted that
although nitro-aerial and igneous particles areos a
saline nature, still they are opposed neither to aeid salt
nor to alkali, but, on the contrary, when combined
with either, increase its power and render it fiery. But
since nitro-aerial particles are fixed in dense number

in the aeid, and in the fixed, salt ol lime, it comes to
