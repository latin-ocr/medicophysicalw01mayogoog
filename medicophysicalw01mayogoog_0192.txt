On Sal Nz‘trum and ll'z'tro-At'rial Spt'rit 159

pass that these contrary salts are kept apart and, as it
were, reconciled by the mediation ol the nitro-aerial
particles which are in harmony with both, so that

they are unable mutually to attack or act upon each .

other. But when these salts are diluted with water,
they lay aside, at least to some extent, their fiery
particles and become less acrid, as will be apparent
if fixed salts exposed to a hot fire are afterwards dis-
solved in water; for then the salts which the fire has
made extremely acrid and caustic will lay aside their
acridity and return to their original state. Hence
it is that the contrary salts of lime, after they have
been dissolved in water, are then fit for acting upon
each other and for mutual effervescence.

And in this we have an explanation of the fact that

quicklime does not become hot when sprinkled with
spirit oswine or other sulphureous liquids of that sort,

as has been said before. For since such liquids are
incapable of dissolving the fixed salt of the lime, they
cannot temper its too acrid and hery force3 yet this
is absolutely necessary for producing its heat.

Ι add, lastly, that the aeid ‚salt of the lime seems to
contract a somewhat dry nature on account of the
very dry and solid nitro-aerial particles densely fixed
iu it ; whence it is that that aeid spirit can remain so
long in the hottest rire.¹ For the extremely solid
nitro-aerial particles, densely fixed in the aeid salt,
make it somewhat rigid‚ so that its particles cannot
be carried aloft by any force of fire. And hence it
is that that aeid salt ol lime, being of a drier nature,
will not engage with its fixed salt until it has been
dissolved by pouring water upon it.

But yet another difficulty is here presented. For
admitting that contrary salts exist in lime and in the
water in which it has been slaked, how does it
