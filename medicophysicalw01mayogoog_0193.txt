happen that these opposing salts, even after they have
acted upon each other, should reside in the said water
with their strength almost unimpaired? For neither
is utterly destroyed, but each of the two performs the
operations appropriate to its nature, as was shown
above; while yet in other cases when opposite salts
are mixed, either both succumb, after a struggle in
which each engages with equal strength, or one of
them gains the mastery while the other is completely
conquered.

In regard to this, it is probable that although in the
lime and in the water in which it is slaked, the acid salt
and the fixed salt combined together are changed into
some neutral substance, yet the aeid salt and the fixed
saltare of such a kind as to be by no means fit ior
mutually subjugating themselves and destroying their
powers. But to make this more intelligible, it will be
of advantage, I think, to premise some brief observa·
tions on the combination of contrary salts with each
other and with other substances.

PRECIPITA TION

ln the first place, then, it is to be noticed that ι

although aeid salts and alkalies pass into a neutral
substance when they meet, yet they do not, as is
generally supposed, entirely destroy each other. For
example, when the acid spirit of salt is coagulated with
a volatile salt (and the same explanation applies to
sal alkali), although the mixed salts seem to be
destroyed, yet they may be separated from each
other with their forces unimpaired, as takes place
when sal armoniae (or any volatile salt combined with
an aeid spirit) is distilled with salt of tartar. For in
this case whatever of acid there is in the sal armoniae
