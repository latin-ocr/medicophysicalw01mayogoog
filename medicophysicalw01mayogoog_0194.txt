On Sal Nitmm and nitro-Amal Spirit 161

will be coagulated with the fixed salt estanar, but the
volatile salt, of which it also in part consists, ascends
of the same nature as before. And the reason oi this
is, that the aeid spirit oi salt is capable of entering
into closer union with any fixed salt than it is with
a volatile salt, so that it immediately leaves the volatile
salts that it may be combined more intimately with
the fixed salt. But if oil of vitriol is united with salt of
tartar‚ they can scarcely he separated from each other.
And yet this is not because these salts have mutually
destroyed each other, but because there is nothing in
nature with which either of thern can unite more
firmly than they do with each other.

As acid salts leave volatile salts to form a closer
union with the fixed salt ol tartar, as being a more
suitable partner‚ so doubtless fixed salts select some
one aeid in preference to others that they may corn-
bine with it in a closer union.

But to illustrate this by an example: if oil of vitriol
is poured upon nitre, which consists of an alkaline
and of a volatile acid salt (as was shown above), the
fixed salt of the nitre will soon leave its own aeid and
will enter into union with the acid of the vitriol, which

- is more concordant with it; so that nitrous aeid,

on account of the mixture with the vitriolic aeid, is
correctly said to be precipitated from the embraces oi
the alkaline salt. That the case is s0, is clear, for
if nitre mixed with oil of vitriol be distilled, the
spirit or aeid salt of the nitre will pass under a mild
heat into the receiving vessel, while yet in other
circumstances that spirit will not be carried up except
by a very vehement fire. No doubt it' is because the
volatileacid saltos the nitre has been expelled from
the society oi the alkaline salt by the more fixed
vitriolic aeid that the acid of nitre, now liberated from
