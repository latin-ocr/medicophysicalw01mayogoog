union with the alkaline salt, ascends under a heat no
greater than is required for the rectification of the
spirit of nitre; while in other circumstances the
same spirit of nitre is sundered only with difficulty
from its union with fixed salt, and requires a very
intense heat forits distillation.

It is a corroboration of this view that the mass left
in the retort aiter a distillation of this kind, closely
resembles vitriolated tartar, and can be properly suh
stituted ior it. For since the alkaline salt os which

⁹ uitreis in part composed, differs scarcely at all from

salt of tartar,a union oi that salt with oil of vitriol
will produce an acido-saline salt, differing not much
from vitriolated tartar.

Nor isit mutually among themselves only that
salts strive after union, but also with other things, and
from them they part so as to combine with a salt
more concordant with themselves. For example, any
aeid spirit at once attacks metals and combines with
them to form vitriol. But if salt oi tartar be poured
upon these vitriols dissolved in water, the acid salt of
the vitriols immediatelycombines with the salt of tartar,
and the metal, freed from the ietters of the aeid salt,
will fall headlong to the bottom.

As an aeid salt combines with metals, so also does
an alkaline salt with sulphur. Is, however, an alkaline
salt in union with sulphur be dissolved in water, and
then any acid spirit be poured into the solution, the
fixed salt will instantly rush into un'ion with the
acid salt ; and the sulphur, meanwhile, liberated from
its union with the fixed salt, and rising in adrial form,
will indicate its presence by its fetid odour—as·

happens when sulphur dissolved in lye is precipitated ’
by the addition of an acid liquid.
Nor is it with an alkali only but also with the
