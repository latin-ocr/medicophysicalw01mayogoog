metals allied to it that sulphur seeks lor union; yet
in such wise that the metals, like the alkaline salt,
will at once leave it to form a more intimate union
with an acid poured upon it. For isan aeid liquid
such as aqua fortis be poured upon a metal rich in
sulphur, say antimony, and then the mixture be
heated, the sulphur will be sublimed to a considerable
extent, since the acid salt of the liquid uniting with
the metal expels its sulphur from its lodgment.

Lastly‚ as metals leave their own sulphur that they
may combine with an aeid salt, so sulphur will quit
metals with which it is united, to coalesce in a closer
union witha fixed salt. For if a metal abounding in
sulphur, such as stibzam, be boiled in strong lye, the
metallic sulphur will dissolve in it, since the sulphur
seeks to be united with the fixed salt of the lye rather
than with the metal; but this metallic sulphur will be
precipitated also from the fixed salt, if an acid salt is
poured upon it.

It is also to be noticed here that although sulphur,
like an acid salt, can combine with an alkaline salt
and with metals, and can be precipitated from them,
we must not therefore suppose that a certain acid
salt (such as the Oleum Sulpharals per Campanam)
lies hidden in a mass of sulphur, and that by its
intervention the alkaline salt unites with the sulphur.
For if alkaline salt and sulphur united together (as
in liver of sulphur) be dissolved in water, and the
acid oil of sulphur be then added, the sulphur im-

mediately thrust out from its union with the fixed ·

salt will be precipitated. And yet, if the combina-
tion of the sulphur with the fixed salt resulted from
' this, namely, that the acid salt contained in the sulphur
unites with the alkaline salt, then the pouring os that
acid or oil of sulphur upon them when combined with
