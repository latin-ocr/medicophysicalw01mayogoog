ecch other would by no means separate them from
each other. Nayâ€š if such an aeid existed in sulphur,
it would hinder altogether the union of the sulphur
and the alkaline salt, since all acids (but especially
one so corrosive as oil of sulphur) have the power oi
separating sulphur from fixed salt and precipitating it.
I further remark that aeid salts do not combine with
alkaline salt or even with metals, without effervescencc
and a notable degree of heat. But such is not the
case when sulphur combines with either of them 3 so
that clearly the combination of sulphur with fixed salt
would appear to result not so much from any
antagonism as from their mutual affinity, as has
already been shown in some detail.

I may here further remark, by the way, that salts
of different kinds should not without the greatest
caution be compounded together in the same medicine,
last one of them should entirely destroy the efficacy of
another, and even change it into something quite
different from what it was at first. For example,
when obstructions or a diminished fermentation ol the
blood, point to the use ol steel, it seems to me
inadvisable to mix the salt oi wormwood or any
lixivial salt with the vitriol of Mars or with the
aperitive Crocus Martis. For when that medicine
dissolves in the stomach, the aeid salt which the
vitriol of Mars contains will immediately unite with
the lixivial salt, and meanwhile the metallis part of the
vitriol, driven out from its acid fellowship ol the salt,
will be precipitated as Colcothar or astringent Crocus
Martis, which is by no means aperitive. For the case
will be very much as ii the acid salt of the said vitriol

were expelled by lire, when nothing metallis will be
left but Colcothar or astringent Crocus Martis. And
indeed the lixivial salt also mixed with the said vitriol,
