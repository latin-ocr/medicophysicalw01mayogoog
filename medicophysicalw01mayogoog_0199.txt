presently be precipitated with fetid odour. For
although already in the slaking of the lime the

alkaline salt of the lime has united with its acid, not
without effervescence and a quite notable heat, yet it
will nevetheless immediately desert the acid betrothed
to it to be married in closer wedlock with the vitriolic
acid, by which however its powers are so completely
overcome that the alkaline salt ol the lime combined
with the vitriolic acid is no longer able as before to
dissolve sulphur; but that a fixed salt is combined
with an acid salt in the water in which quicklime has
been slaked, and further that the heat ol that water is
caused by the union of contrary salts, will be made
still clearer by what isto be said below.

Since the contrary salts in the water in which
quicklime has been slaked arc but little lit for entering
into a very close union and for mutually destroying
each others powers, each ol them consequently can
perlorm the operations appropriate to its own nature.
And this is seen clearly in sal armoniae, in which the'
aeid salt is combined with a volatile salt, and yet that
acid salt is not so completely subdued by its unequal
adversary, the volatile salt united with it, as to be
unable to dissolve· iron as acids do and to change it
into vitriol. Yet il any fixed salt contends with the
acid armoniae salt, then indeed its strength is com-
pletely destroyed so that it is quite incapable of dis·
solving iron any longer. And the case in lact seems
to be similar in water of quicklime, lor here the less
opposing salts do not so· completely destroy each
other but that either ol them can act according to its
nature. For the fixed salt ol that water is able to
dissolve sulphur, and its acid salt can fix and destroy
volatile salts, as was said above.

With respect to water which has slaked quicklime,
