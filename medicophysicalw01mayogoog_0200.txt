On Sal mmm and Meo-Aeria! Spr‘n't 167

we note further that oil of vitriol, when put into it,
does not produce in it effervescence, or precipitation,
or any degree ol heat. And yet it is certain that the
aeid salt of vitriol unites with the fixed salt of the
lime. For it spirit of vitriol be poured into a solution
of sulphur made in water that has slaked quicklime, the
sulphur will be immediately precipitated, as we have
already remarked. And yet this would certainly not
happen unless the aeid of the vitriol uniting with the
fixed salt of the lime drove the sulphur from its
lodgment.

But to make the reason of this clear, it should be
noted that if salts which are somewhat saturated and
weakened by their opposites‚ afterwards meet a salt
that is still more repugnant, there will yet be no
effervescenee or heat from their mutual action as there
would be in other circumstances. For example, if οἱ]
of vitriol be united with any metal whatever with a
distinet ebullition (as is the ease when iren is
dissolved in oil of vitriol) and then fixed salt of tartar
is put into that solution, although the aeid spirit of
the vitriol combines with the salt ol tartar, and the
metal now liberated from the acid salt is precipitated,
still no ebullition or heat will be produced in sofar as
the aeid spirit of the vitriol was previously to some
extent saturated by the metal joined to it. And the
same thing also happens when salt of tartar is mixed
with a solution of sal armoniae. For when this is
done the salt of tartar absorbs, without any ebullition,
whatever acid there is in the sal armoniae.

And fora perfeetly similar reason the alkaline salt
ol the water in which quicklime has been slaked unites
without any effervescence with oil of vitriol poured
into it, because the alkaline salt of the lime has been
previously saturated with its own aeid. Consequently
