that the water in which quicklime has been slaked is
impregnated with contrary salts and these combined
with each other, is clearly evidenced by the fact that
the alkaline salt ol that water unites with any aeid
salt whatever, and its aeid salt with volatile. salt,
without any effervescence or heat.

But further, that the precipitation may be seen in
any liquid and that the liquid may become turbid‚ it
is indispensably necessary that what is precipitated
should be opaque and not transparent, in order that ’
as it descends it may fill the pores of the liquid and so
hinder rays of light from being transmitted through
them, as happens in the precipitation of iron or ol any
other metal. For when iron dissolved by an aeid
liquid is driven from its embraces, it is no longer
transparent but resumes its previous state, namely‚
that of asolid and opaque body, so that the iron, as
it goes down, obstructs the pores of the liquid and
renders it turbid.

But if that which is precipitated be nowise opaque,
but transparent or soluble in the liquid, then the
liquid in which the precipitation takes place will be-
come in noway turbid. Hence when oil of tartar per
deliquium is mixed with a solution of sal armoniac,
although the fixed salt of tartar absorbs the acid of
the sal armoniae and the volatile armoniae salt is
precipitated from its union with its partner, still the
liquid does not become in the least turbid‚ because
that volatile salt, in the course of its descent‚ dissolves
in the liquid and does not at all obstruet its pores.
SimiInrly, when an acid salt is precipitated from its
union with a fixed salt by the addition ol a more
appropriate acid (as happens when the alkali of which
nitre partly consists leaves the nitrous acid and com·
bines with oil ol vitriol poured upon it, or also when
