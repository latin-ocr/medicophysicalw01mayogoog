On Sal Nitrum and Nalm-At'n‘al spirit 169

the alkaline salt of quicklime leaves its own aeid and
combines with the aeid of vitriol)‚ although the aeid
salt is first precipitated from the embrace of the
alkaline salt, still the liquid does not become in the
least degree turbid, because that aeid salt which siuks
is in nowise opaque but soluble in the liquid, and
consequently transparent and imperceptible.

Nor should we omit to state that quicklime mixed
with the lye of ashes renders it more powerful and
acrid. And yet in water which has slaked lime the
acid salt, which is entirely opposed to the lixivial salt,
seems to have the upper hand, since precipitation will
take place in that water if an alkaline salt is put into
it, as was said before.

ln regard to this it is probable that the aqueous
part of the lye, when poured upon quicklime, no
sooner meets the very fiery and dry acid salt of the

lime and renders it fit as it were for dissolving‚ so that
it effervesces with the alkaline salt (for it was shown
above that the acid of lime does not, unless diluted
with water, effervesce with an opposite salt), than
the alkaline salt with which the lye is imbued com·
bines at once with the acid salt of the lime and so

destroys its powers that the alkaline salt which
belongs to the lime is not now, as in other cases,
conquered and subjugated by the acid of the lime, but
may be extracted from the water of the lye with its
powers unimpaired. Since, therefore, the alkaline salt
of quicklime is extremely acrid and fiery, it necessarily
follows that the lixivial water impregnated with it
becomes in the highest degree biting‚ caustic, and
fiery.
