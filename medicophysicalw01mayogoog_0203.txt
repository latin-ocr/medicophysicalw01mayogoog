OF THE THERMAL WATERS OF ΒΑ ΤΗ.
INCIDENTAlLl', OF THE SOURCE OF SPRINGS

Arione the most famous thermal waters are to be
reckoned those of Bath, for in these wonderful waters
there dwells perpetually a vestal and sacred tire-a
friendly treaty ¹being as it were formed between
elements the most discordant.

Before coming to the question of how these springs
are warmed, it will be of advantage, I think, to make a
brief inquiry into the ingredients of their waters.

In the first place, then, it is evident that the Bath
thermal waters are impregnated with a salt of an acid
nature, for if any alkaline or purely volatile salt is
mixed with their waters, a precipitation will
immediately be produced in them, and they will
become turbid and milky Further, warmed milk will
be coagulated if the water of these thermal springs is
poured into it, precisely as if any aeid liquid were
used,

And yet the salt of the springs does not appear to
be acid pure and simple, but combined with some
alkaline salt: for if that water be evaporated to
dryness, a salt of a more fixed nature will be found at
the bottom of the vessel, since it effervesces if any
acid spirit is poured on it. Of this nature, too, are the
mud and sand of the springs which are thrown out
along with the bubbling stream of water, for if any
acid liquid is poured upon them, a marked ebullition
will immediately be produced. It is also to be
observed that a salt in these waters, or rather a limy
