earth, adheres almost everywhere to the bottom ol
the channels by which the waters are carried off.
From what has been said, it may be inferred that
the thermal waters of Bath are impregnated with a
certain acido-saline salt. And indeed this salt of the
thermal waters does not seem to be very unlike
vitriolated tartar or aluminous salt. But the reason
why these salts do not destroy each other, hut that
each of them effervesces with a salt opposed to it, will
be to some extent intelligible from what was said in
the previous chapter. For the said salts are so
imperfect that they are not able to destroy each other

entirely when they combine together. But there will
be a fuller discussion of these salts afterwards.

As lor nitre and sulphur, with which it has been
hitherto supposed that the Bath thermal waters are
impregnated, I think that neither of them exists

dissolved in the water ol these springs.

That nitre does not exist in them is evident,
because il the salts which remain after evaporating
the water ol the baths are placed on burning charcoal‚
they in nowise deflagrate like nitre. However, I
will not ’deny that the immature salts ol an alkaline
nature (with which the mud and sand oi the baths are
imbued) may, perhaps, il exposed for some time to the
air, be changed by its influence into nitre.

As to sulphur, which is so often said to be present
in nearly all thermal springs, my opinion is that it
does not exist dissolved in these waters. For if a
solution of alum, or of vitriol‚ or any other salt,
whether acid or fixed, is mixed with the water of
these thermal springs, the precipitation of sulphur is
not at all indicated either by a fetid odour or by any
other sign. And yet that always happens in solution
of sulphur made in the water in which quicklime has
