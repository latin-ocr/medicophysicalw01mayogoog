be dissolved in the said waters‚I think the source of
the error lies in the fact that the decoction was made
in a nessei, used for such purposes‚ in which perhaps
at some time a fixed salt had been boiled; so that the
solution of the sulphur might be caused by a small
portion oi the fixed salt with which the vessel was
imbued.

It is generally believed that if silver be immersed in
the hot Bath waters it will receive a yellow tinge, just
as if it were put into a solution of sulphur 3 and hence
the common belief that these thermal waters are
impregnated with sulphur3 but the contrary of this
hasbeen ascertained by experiment. For silver put in
the baths does not become at all red or yellow, but
rather blach But the error seems to arise from this,
that the keepers of the baths are in the habit of
tinging and as it were gilding silver coins witha
saline-sulphureous mud such as is found everywhere
in sewers, and then selling them for a small sum to
visitors, as coins coloured by the waters of the baths.

It should also be noticed here that a certain
bituminous mud and a small quantity of common
sulphur are usually thrown out along with the gush·
ing waters of the thermal springs3 yet these eithe
float on the surfaoe of the waters or lie at the bottom,
but are in nowise dissolved in the said waters.

Nor are the said thermal waters impregnated with
armoniae salt, as some have supposed; for if salt of
tartaris put into a solution of sal armoniae, the simply
saline volatile salt (of which sal armoniae partly
consists), released from the letters of the aeid salt with
which it was previously united, will instantly rise in
vapours and will soon betray its presence by assailing
the nostrils which approach it. But this in noway
happens with the thermal waters.
