Lastly‚ as regards vitriol, the bath usually called the
Cross Bath, and also the one named the Hot Bath,
appear to contain no vitriol whatever. Foris pounded
gall-nuts are infused in the waters of the said bathe,
the waters will by no means assume a purple or a
black colour, and yet this would certainly be the case
if these waters were imbued with vitriol. With
respect to the so-called King’s Rath, it seems to be
impregnated with a little vitriol; for if pounded gall-
nuts are put into its water, it will be slightly tinged
with a blackish·purple‚ ,

But it should be noted that along with the gushing
waters of the said hot springs, there rushes out from
the earth a mineral of a metallic nature which can
easily be changed into vitriol. For if any aeid liquid
is poured on the saud which escapes from the earth
along with the water of the hot springs and is found
at the bottom of the baths, this sand, when corroded
with considerable effervescence by the aeid menstruum,
will in part be turned into vitriol, just as iron filings
are when corroded by an acid liquid. Foris that
sand of the baths, when impregnated with an aeid
liquid, be added to an infusion of galls‚ the liquid will
at once acquire a dark purple colour; while, on the
other hand, if the infusion of galls be poured upon
the sand when taken fresh from the baths (but not
yet corroded by an aeid liquid), it will not become
purple at all—undoubtedly a clear proof that the
metallic sand of the baths assumes the vitriolic nature
only when corroded by an acid menstruum. It is to
be noticed also that this sand of the hot springs will
spontaneously change into vitriol if kept for a con·
siderable time and exposed to the air; for if such
sand is put into an infusion of galls‚ the water will at
once take a dark purple colour. Nay, if it be put on
