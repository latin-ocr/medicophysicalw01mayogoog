On Sal Meum and Nitro-At'rial Spirit 175

the tongue, the taste of vitriol will be manifest
enough. Indeed nitro-aerial spirit, after alapse of
time, unites and effervesces with the metallic mineral
or saline-sulphureous marchasite (such as vitriol is
usually made from) which is mixed'in the said sand,
and at last turns it into vitriol in the manner
described in another place.

Let us next consider how not only the hot springs
of Bath but all thermal springs acquire their heat.
With regard to the heat of thermal springs, 1 cannot
agree with those who maintain that their heat is due
to warmth communicated by subterranean fire. For
if any fire ol this sort burned in the bowels of the
earth, it would certainly betray itself by its flame
bursting out somewhere; since indeed a continual
influx of air is absolutely necessary for the mainten-
ance of fire. But granting that there are subterranean
lires, how is it,I ask, that they are not extinguished
by the waters which they are supposed to heatl
And whence should the material be supplied sor-
maintaining a fire so vast and enduringl

Wherefore, since it is not probable that the hot
springs are heated by subterranean lires, we may
maintain with our learned countryman, Jordan, that
the warming of the hot springs originates in
fermentation excited sornewhere in the bowels of the
earth. But to understand how this fermentation is
produced the following must be premised.

In the first place, then, it may reasonably be
supposed that at any rate most fountains derive their
origin from rain-water. For it is not probable that
anyof them are derived, as is generally believed,
from the sea; for who can entertain the idea that the
gushing waters which burst forth from the summits
of the loftiest mountains have their origin in the
