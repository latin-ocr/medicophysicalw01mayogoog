depths of the sea? For it is by no means to be
believed that sea-water ascends by filtration to the
tops of mountains3 for in whatever way any liquid
may rise up through a tilter, yet it will not flow out
ol the filter unless its other end is at a lower level
than the liquid ; and consequently sea-water obviously
cannot gush out by means of filtration from places at
a higher level than the ocean itself.

Whether sea-water, which, in consequence of being
impregnated with salt, is heavier than spring-water,
is comparatively so much heavier as· to force
spring-water to the tops of lolty mountains, as the
ingenious Dr R. Hooke has suggested, I will not
definitely say3 yet it can scarcely be thought that any
springs are due to this cause. For if any had their
source in the sea, how are we to explain that most
fountains follow the temperature of the air and almost
fail in very warm weather‚ or also in frost? Should
any one say that the aqueous particles are by reason
ol the greater heat converted into vapours and ascend,
and that therefore the springs dry up in summer, I
ask, how is it then that fountains are diminished when
the earth outside is so bound by frost that the passage
for vapours is entirely closed?

I think, then, that it should be held that at least the
majority ol springs have their origin in rain-water.
And yet I would not be understood as supposing that ·
rain-water is stored in certain subterranean caverns,
as it were in special cisterns, whence it flows out into
springs. For such a supposition is unnecessary when
the thing can be otherwise explained. Now since
the surface of the earth is like a sponge or filter, it can
absorb rain-water in quantity sufficient to form
springs that will endure for a long time. For we
observe that the outer crust of the earth is always
