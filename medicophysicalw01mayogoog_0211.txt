aqueous particles has been placed beyond all doubt
by Boyle’s experiments; for if spring or rain-water
be put in a glass from which the air is exhausted by
suction, innumerable little bubbles, formed of the
substance of air, will burst from it. In fact, as soon
as the pressure of the atmosphere is almost removed,
the aiirial particles dispersed through the mass of the
water immediately open and stretch out in virtue of
their elastic force 37 so that the little portions of air
which previously lay hidden and quite inconspicuous
in the potes of the water, now swell into little bubbles
which are forced upwards on account of their lightness.
Moreover, that air resides in the small pores of water
will be further proved by the following experiment.
For let asmall glass be placed in such away under
water contained in asuitable vessel, that all the air
may escape from it and water enter in its place.
Then let that glass, filled with water, be inverted and
placed at· the bottom of the said vessel, and let it
remain s0, much as in Plate V.‚ Fig. 3. After these
preparations, let the vessel into which the inverted
glass is put be placed on the fire so that the water
contained in it may be heated‚ and then let the vessel
be removed from the fire so that the water may again
cool. When this is done, we shall find that the top
of the inverted glass is occupied by a kind of air
partly composed of the vapours raised from the
boiled water and not yet completely condensed, but
partly of ae'rial matter. For since the air mixed with
the water contained in the glass is rarefied by the
heat of the fire, and consequently occupies more space
than formerly, it is raised in the form of little bubbles
to the top of the glass by the pressure of the
surrounding water. And that this atirial matter is in
part air, I infer also from this, that a certain portion
