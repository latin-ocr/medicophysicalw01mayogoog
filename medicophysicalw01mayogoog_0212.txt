of it will never condense into aliquid. It possesses,
moreover, as much elastic force as ordinary air, as Ι
have ascertained by the method elsewhere described.

To this I add, lastly, that air interspersed in water
is drawn in by fishes lor respiratory purposes. And
indeed the gills with which fishes are endowed seem
to be lormed lor this very end, that air (which is ab·
’ solutely necessary for animal life) may be separated
from the water by their action and mixed most
intimately with the mass of the blood. And the
reason that fishes are always engaged in alternately
drawing in and expelling water, as terrestrial animals
do common air, is that something aerial which is
necessary to life may be separated from the water, as
. in the other case from the air, and passed into the
mass ol the blood.

It corroborates this view that most fishes possessa
swimming·bladder filled with air. For there can be
no doubt that fishes.draw this air from the potes ol
the water. Let me say also in passing that if a fish is
placed in water contained in a suitable vessel from
which the air is exhausted, it will no longer swim on
its belly, but on the contrary on its back. lts belly
will also rise to some extent above the surface of the
water. And the reason seems to be that the air
enclosed in the swimming·bladder expands in virtue
ol its elastic force as soon as the pressure of the
external air is withdrawn‚ so that the said bladder
and also the abdomina} cavity in which it lies are
infiated by the air, with the result that these swollen
parts are forced upwards by the pressure of the water
while the back of the fish descende. But it alter the
fish has died for want ol air, external air is again
admitted into the glass, the fish will immediately sink
to the bottom and its belly will again become flaccid.
