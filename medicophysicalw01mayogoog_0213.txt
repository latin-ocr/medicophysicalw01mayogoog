Whether the air contained in the said bladder can
pass into the massot the blood and supply fishes with
material for respiration l shall not definitely say,
although that such is the case seems to be indicated
by the fact that fishes can live a little longer than
other animals when deprived of air-unless indeed
this should be accounted for by the circumstance that
fishes‚ owing to the'very languid fermentation bf their
blood, consume a comparatively small quantity of air,
so that, unlilre most animnls, they do not need to
have a perpetual supply of air.

And now, since the air is intermingled so largely
with rain-water, it is probable that a saline-sulphureous
mineral effervesces when wetted with rain-water
because the aerial particles‚ which are conducted by
the aqueous particles, enter deep into a mineral of
that nature and effervesco with its saline-sulphureous
part. For Ι have already endeavoured to show that
air is possessed of a highly fermentative nature, and
that nearly all heat results from the effervescence of
something aerial with saline-sulphureous particles.
In fact, a saline-sulphureous mineral of this sort
behaves not very differently from the mass of the
blood, the heat of which arises from this, that the
aerial particles conveyed to it by respiration effervesce
conspicuously with its saline-sulphureous particles‚ as
has been elsewhere pointed out more fully.

Withrespect to the beat of the thermal waters‚'I
think it should be held that the aerial particles which
descend with rain-water into the depths of the earth
and meet there with the saline-sulphureous mineral‚
excite in it a very. intense effervescence and heat; and
that springs of water, flowing from the mineral thus
effervescing, constitute the thermal springs.

Further‚ it may well be supposed that the earth is
