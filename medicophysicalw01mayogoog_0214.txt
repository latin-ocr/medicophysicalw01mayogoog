On Sal Nrilrum and Nalm-Admirl Spin't 181

penetrated in some places by pores of a kind ⁴
suitable for the passage in dense numbers of aerial
parti'cles, and for sucking them in, as it were. For
since the aerial particles, carried to the saline-sul-
phureous mineral and effervescing with it, are swept
. away by the streams of water flowing thence, the
result is that the nearest particles of air are forced by
atmospheric pressure into the place ol those carried
away, while these also are soon absorbed and followed
by others; and thus aerial particles come to the
effervescing mineral in a continual stream.

Perhaps the lofty hills, with deep and abrupt
valleys between, which engirdle Bath on all sideS,
contribute somewhat to the entrance of aerial particles
into the ground and to the maintenance of the heat
ol the thermal waters. For, in consequence ol this,
the air thrown back from the hills, and reflected in
various directions in the ralleys, strikes forcibly
against the ground and is thrust into it.

It is a further prool of the views set forth, that the
Bath waters conrain a saline-sulphureous mineral‚
which seems not very unlike those marchasites from
which vitriol is made ; and indeed the sand ol the baths,
if exposed for some time to the air, will effervesce and
turn into vitriol. But the reason that the salts ol the
said thermal waters are ol an acido-saline nature
seems to be, that when the saline-sulphureous mineral
effervesces in the manner already described, some ol
the saline particles are brought to a certain fluidity,
as was previously remarked. But these salts, when
thus liquefied, unite with the other salts which are ol
an alkaline nature, and lrom these, combined with
one another, a certain acido-saline salt is composed. It
is, however, only an immature salt, since it is swept
away, while not yet duly fermented nor brought to
