proper maturity, by the waters which flow frorn the
effervescing mineral.

Shonld any one now ask how any mineral mn
possibly suffice for so long-continued a fermentation, l

reply that the earth is imbued in certain places with ·

a mineral seed, which, like vegetable seed, grows and
reaches maturity; and that owing to it the waste of
the said mineral is constantly repaired.

Finally, we remark here that nearly all springs
have a certain warmth at their first rise; and indeed
the heat ol spring-water just escaping from the earth
can be quite sensibly lelt in winter when the hand is
immersed in it. No doubt the aerial particles which
descend with rain-water into the earth effervesce in an
obscure motion with the saline-sulphureous particles
of which nearly every kind ol earth is composed3 and
consequently a certain warmth is produced, on which
the growth of vegetables depends, as hasbeen else·
where shown. And hence it is that spring-waters are
lor the most part impregnated with acido-saline salts.
For if salt of tartar is mixed with spring-water, pre-
cipitation usually takes place in it, and, like the
aforesaid thermal waters, it becomes whitish-a clear
prool ol the presence in the water of a salt of an acid
nature. And this, too, is the reason that soap does
not mix·with spring-water; lor the aeid salt of such
water contends with the fixed salt of the soap, and so
destroys its powers that the sulphureous and 0in part
ol the soap cannot be dissolved in the spring-water by
the fixed salt, now subdued, but floats on the surlace
in accordance with its oily nature. Moreover the a‘cid
salt ol spring-water seems to be combined with a
certain alkaline salt, although the latter be immature 5
and therefore it is, that oil of vitriol, when mixed
with this water, produces a kind of effervescence.
