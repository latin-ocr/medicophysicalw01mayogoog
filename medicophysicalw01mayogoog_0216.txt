SECOND TREA Τ ISE

ΟΝ RESPIRATION

THE lungs are placed in a recess so sacred and hidden
that nature would seem to have specially withdrawn
this part both from the eyes and from the intellect;
for, beyond the wish, it has not as yet been granted
to any one to fit a window to the breast and redeem
from darkness the profounder secrets of nature. For
of all the parts of the body, the lungs alone, as if
shrinking from observation, cease lrom their move·
meut and collapse at once on the first entrance of
light and seh-revelation. Hence such an ignorance of
Respiration anda sort of holy wonder. still, let me
draw near to the inmost virals, and, concerning so
obscure a matter, make at least a guess.

In discussing on Respiration I shall follow the
method pointed out by nature and begin therefore
with inspiration.

Every one knows that when we inspire, air rushes
into the expanded chest and 'inflates the lungs. But
authorities are· not equally agreed as to the cause of
the air rushing in with such vehemence. Some
account for it by a vacuum and an attraction ofI

know negt what imaginary sort.
