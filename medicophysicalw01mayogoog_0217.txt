Others again suppose that the air about the chest,
pushed lorward by its expansion, propels that which is
next it, and this again the next ; and that so the pro·
pulsion goes on, and thus at last the air near the
mouth is driven into the lungs.

But indeed this view assumes that every place is
full and that this immense space cannot admit any
additional air, however little. But there is no reason
for having recourse to this fulness when the thing can
be and ought to be explained otherwise; for we may
believe that propulsion of that kind cannot take place

in air, as it isa fluid and easily moved. But this will
be made clearer by the following experiment. For
let us suppose that the narrow neck ol a large enough
glass vessel is put into one’s mouth ; then, the nostrils
being firmly closed, let the air be sucked from the
’ glass and drawn into the lungs, which will certainly
happen il inspiration begins, the chest being dilated.

But certainly in this case, such a propulsion ol the
air from the thorax to· the lungs cannot be propa-
gated, because ol the interposition ol the glass
But perhaps you will say that some more subtle
matter passes through the glass and is pushed into
the thorax, and that this serves as material lor respira-
tion. But indeed if the case were su, how could it be
explained that a small animal shut up in a completely
closed glass will soon die, if particles suitable for
respiration still pass through the glass?

With respect, then, to the entrance of the air into
the lungs, 1 think it is, to be maintained that it is
caused in the following manner by the pressure of the
atmosphere. For as the air, on account ol the weight
of the superincumbent atmosphere‚ not only rushes
into all empty places, but also presses lorcibly upon
whatever is next it (as Boyle’s experiments have put
