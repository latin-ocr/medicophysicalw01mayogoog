beyond doubt), it follows that the air, passed through
the nostrils and the trachea. up to the bronchia or
gates ol the lungs, presses against the lungs lrom
within and seeks an entrance into them. Hence it is
that when the inner sides of the thorax (which by
compressing the lungs from without were resisting
the pressure ol this air) are drawn outwards by
muscles whose function it is to dilate the obest, and
the space in the thorax is enlarged, the air which is
nearest the bronchial inlets, now that every obstacle
is removed, rushes under the lull pressure of the
atmosphere into the cavities of the lungs, and by
inflating them occupies and fills the space of the
expanded chest.

The structure ol the lungs is adapted lor their
inflation as thus described, lor their substance is
composed, as the eminent Dr Malpighi has noted, ol
very fine mernb'ranes, which form an almost infinite
number of spherical vesicles whose mutual connection
is such that there is easy access from the trachea to
those nearest to it, and from these again to others.
Consequently when these vesicles are inflated by an

inrush of air, the whole substance ol the lungs must
necessarily expand.

Nor is it only the pressure of the atmosphere, but
also the elastic lorce ol the air by which it tends to
expand indefinitely, that serves to inflate the lungs
and cause inspiration, as takes place whenÎ‡ the air, on
the nostrils being closed, is drawn into the lungs (in
the manner already described) lrom a glass placed in
the mouth, and also when a small animal breathes in
a glass that hasbeen completely closed. For though
the weight ol the atmosphere does not, owing to the
interposition ol the glass, press or impel the air which
it contains, still the air, in virtue ol its elastic force,
