rushes into the expanded chest and lungs of the
breathing animal and inflates them.

And indeed the force with which air that has not
yet expanded seeks to enlarge its volume, is exactly
equal to the pressure of the atmosphere‚ inasmuch
as it depends upon it, and increases or diminishes
according as this pressure is greater or less. F or the
elastic·force of the air seems to be due to this, that
the air, especially that near the earth, is compressed
and its volume diminished by the weight of the
superincumbent· air 3 hence it is that it always strives
to expand‚ just as a fleece, when the force which
compressed it is withdrawn, instantly unlolds and
expands with a certain motion of restitution. And
this can be confirmed by a well enough known experi-
ment.

Foris a bladder with most of the air pressed out of
it, and tied bya tight ligature round the sphincter,
be placed in a glass from which the air is alterwards
exhausted‚ we shall at once see the bladder swell and
become greatly distended‚ a rather pretty sight by the
way. For although a very little air was contained in
the bladder, yet when the external air (by the pres-
sure os which it was reduced to small volume) is
removed, it immediately expands and inflates the
bladder, indeed sometimes violently bursts it. And,
in lact, the inflation ol the lungs is effected ina not
very different way. For as soon as the sides'of the

thorax (which by compressing the lungs make them
shrink) are drawn outwards, the air at the entrance to
the lungs is immediately driven into them, whether
by atmospheric pressure or in consequence of its own
elastic force, and distends them.

But we may illustrate the inflation ol the lungs in
this way by yet another example. Let us then
