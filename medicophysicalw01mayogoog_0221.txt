'It will be urged by those who maintain that the i
lungs move of themselveS, that when the thorax ¹is ’
wounded the lobes of the lungs usually burst from
the cavity in the chest and protrude through the
opening of the wound, which would by no means
happen if the lungs merely followed the movement of
the chest and did not expand os themselves. This
difficulty is thus answered by the learned Dr High-
more. The air, he says, pressing violently into the
expanded chest and the lungs, does not instantly cease
hom its motion, but rushes where the way lies open
and carries the lungs with it, on account of their
extreme lightnesS, beyond the cavity of the thorax.
But with all respect to such a man, the lungs do not
(as l have ascertained by vivisections) protrude
through the opening made bya wound in the chest
unless the thorax is contracted; when, namely, the
air does not, as the eminent man supposeS, rush into
the lungs, but, on the contrary, is driven 'out ol them.
-So that it should rather be said, l think, that the
lungs are so compressed by the thorax, which is
everywhere contracted, that they burst forth where
there is an outlet, that is, through the aperture of the
wound 3 just as we see a sponge tightly compressed
by the hands, protrude between the fingers il they
are kept a little apart. But afterwards, when the
chest expands and the lungs are no longer com-
pressed by the sides oi the thorax, now drawn
outwards, the lobe of the lungs, which protruded
beyond the cavity oi the chest, will immediately
return to it, unless perhaps, in consequence of its
being caught tightly in the lips of the wound, the
‹outlet for the air is closed and the lobe is kept inflated
outside the thorax. ·
