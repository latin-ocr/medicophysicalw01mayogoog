has been said, that, in trifling wounds of the chest, ’
the lungs are yet observed to move somewhat. For
although the air rushes into the thorax through the
aperture ol the wound, so that the lungs are externally
compressed by it, still air, in quantity sufficient to fill
the dilated chest, cannot enter immediately on
account of the smallness ol the wound, and therefore
air to ¹fill the chest must rush in partly through the
wound and partly through the trachea. Hence the
lungs only partially expand, in the space, namely, of
the enlarged thorax, as yet unoccupied by the air
entering through the wound. But when the chest
contractS, most of the air which has entered through
the wound is expelled through the aperture ol the
wound, since its volume is too great to be retained in

the now diminished cavity. When the chest, how· ·

ever, once more dilates, the air, as before, rushes not
only through the wound but also by the trachea, into
the· lungs and dilates them (although with greater
difficulty on account of the mass it has to raise), and
in this way some motion of the lungs is kept up in
the wounded chest.

Here, by the way, surgeons should be warned not
to close the wound il the chcst has been perforated
except when the thorax is contracted to the utmost;
for, otherwise, it the opening made by the wound is
closed when the chest is dilated (that is, when the air
has filled the interior cavity of the thorax), it will be
impossible lor the chest to coutract on account oi the
resistance of the air inside, or for the lungs to expand,
except partially, and, in consequence, suffocation will
necessarily follow.

Now that it has been shown that the entrance of
air into the lungs depends upon the dilatation ol the
chest, it remains for investigation how the chest is
