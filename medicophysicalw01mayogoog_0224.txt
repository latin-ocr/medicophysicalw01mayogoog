On Respri‘ation 191

more then the ribs arched over the said plane (or
what is the same thing, over the spine and sternunt,
which are in that plane) approach to right angles, so
much the greater will be the space which lies
between the raised ribs and thc mediastinum, as we
have already shown. And thus it· is clear that one
half of the chest is expanded by the ribs being raised
towards right angles, and it is evidently the same
with the other side. As for the false ribs, although
their extremities are connected not with the eternum
but with the diaphragm, they have notwithstanding the
same motion, and in like manner dilate the chest. But
since the ribs when drawn upwards approach nearer
to right angles with the spine, and the ribs when
raised to right angles open upa space in the thorax,
it follows that when the ribs are drawn upwards they
dilate the chest, which is what we undertook to prove.
Nay, any one can experience in himself that the ribs
are drawn upwards in inspiration and the dilatation of
the chest, but that they descend in expiration and the
contractiori of the chest.

This premised, if the ribs are raised by the inter-
costal muscles, even the internal ones (which has next
to be proved), it follows necessarily that the chest is
dilated by their contractiori. ’

Whenever, I say, a muscle attached to two bones
contracts, the bone which is less fixed moves towards
the other which is more fixed. Wherefore, since
every lower rib is less fixed than the one above it,
each of the lower ribs must be elevated when the
intercostal rnuscles, even the internal ones, contract.
For a quite similar reason holds with the internal as
with the external muscles; nor is it an objection to
this that the former are attached to the ribs in a
different position, as is obvious from Plate IL, Fig. a,
