where the interior muscle a, a, will raise the lower
and more mobile rib, in contracting, as well as the
exterior muscle, b, b. And here itis to be noted
that the ribs are so articulated with the spine that
when they are pulled by the said muscles they easily
ascend and are raised with rotation.

Nay, the very position ol the muscles makes this
plain, for if the interior muscle which is placed
between the two lowest ribs were to pull the upper
of the two downwards, all the ribs‚ since they are
firmly attached to each other, would necessarily be
drawn downwards at the same time, a thing which
that weak and membrane-like muscle cannot do,
How much more probable is it that the lower
ribs are all drawn upwards together by the internal
muscles between the upper ribs‚ for these are suffi-
ciently strong and broad, while the weaker muscles
between the lower ribs contribute merely to elevate
the lower ribs‚ These things will be more clearly
seen from Fig. 3, which shows the ribs and the
internal muscles.

And this view is also supported by the oblique and
contrary position os the intercostal muscles. For
Nature seems to have inserted these muscles obliquely
in the ribs (although a direct insertion would have
suited better for moving thern up or down) because
the intervals between the ribs are so small that if
these muscles had been inserted at right angles, they
would have been shorter than the nature of muscles
admits. Wherefore, that these muscles should have a
suitable length, they had to be inserted obliquely (as
they are) to the ribs‚ Yet as this oblique position is
less suitable for elevating the ribs, Nature, that most
wise engineer, has arranged the nruscles with divers
aspects so that while they pull the ribs obliquely with
