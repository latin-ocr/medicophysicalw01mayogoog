equal force in this direction and in that, the ribs
meanwhile rise straight upwards, as is shown in
Plate IL, Fig. 4, where, when the external muscle a, a,
and the interna} c, c, contract together, the lower and
more mobile rib will rise not obliquely but straight
upwards, just as though it were pulled by a muscle
attached to it at right angles. So that clearly the
external and internal muscles contract simultaneously,
and by their united effort elevate the ribs and expand
the chest. Moreover, that the internal muscles do ,
not cause expiration, may be gathered from the fact
that the thorax in a dead animal is always con·
, tracted, sor to die and to expire mean the same
thing; but in the dead, the action of the muscles

altogether ceases; and so this contraction of the
chest cannot be caused by the internal muscles, since
they no longer contract. Should any one remark

here that that contraction of the thorax is caused
by the internal muscles immediately before the death
of the animal, I ask, in reply‚ how then is it that the
external muscles (since the two cases are similar)
never contract in the dying, so that the chest should
remain for some time dilatedi

It is probable then that, in expiration, the parts of-
the thorax return, by a movement of restitution, to
their natural position without any aid from the
muscles. For it is difficult and contrary to their
natural position for the ribs to be drawn upwards, so
that for this there is indispensable need of the two-
fold and united action of both sets of muscles, the in·
ternal and the external. But the ribs sink down again,
without any work, as is clear in the case of a dead
animal or a skeleton. Wherefore there is no reason
for saying that Nature has provided as much muscular
power for the latter action, which is clearly no
