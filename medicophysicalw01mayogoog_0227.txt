action, as for the former, which is indeed a very difficult
one.

And here it should be noticed that the ribs are
joined to the spine, not as is commonly believed with
a single but with a double articulation, and that these
joints are placed so obliquely, and shaped with such
contrivanee, that the ribs cannot be raised by the
intercostal muscles without being at the same time
drawn outwards for the greater dilatation oi the
chest, as is clearly seen in Plate ΙΙ., F ig. 5: in which
let a, e, i, be a portion of a rib whose round head, a,
enters c, the socket hollowed in the spine; this
articulation is superior and interior. On the con-
trary, in the other articulatim, the lower and
exterior, a cavity, but a less conspicuous one, is
hollowed out in the rib at e, and is articulated with
the protuberance ol the spine at b. And now, if we
suppose the head, a, of the rib to be placed in the
socket, c, of the spine, and the hollow of the rib, e, to
rest on the protuberance, b, of the spine, and then

the rib connected with the spine by these two '

articulations to be moved upwards‚ it is easily under·
stood that the rib will be carried to the left, or, what
¹is the same thing, outwards, in respect to the chest.
These articulations, and also their obliquity, are
more noticeable in the skeleton of a sheep or of a horse
than in that ol a man. For it is to be observed that
these articulations are much more oblique in some

animals than in others ; in animals, namely, which, Ι

destined ior more violent exercise, have need of more
yiolent respiration, the joints of the ribs are very
oblique, in order that their ribs may be drawn more
outwards by the contractiori of the intercostal m'uscles,
and that space enough may be opened in the chest

for a sufficiently large expansion oi the lungs. '
