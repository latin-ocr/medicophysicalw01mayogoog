On Respiration 195

Nor should it be overlooked that the cartilages, by
the interposition of which the ribs are joined to the
sternum‚ are inserted into the ribs with very notable
obliquity, as is shown in Plate 11, F ig. 3, in which a, c,
is a rib, c, e, the cartilage, by means of which the rib
is united to the sternum‚ e, the angle formed by the
junction of the two, The obliquity, morcover, has for
its object that the ribs may be extended and drawn
outwards, circularly.

It is, besides, to be noted that in inspiration,
especially when violent, the extremities of the false
ribs move a little inwards ; and the reason is that the
diaphragm is joined to both ends of the false ribs,
with the result that when it contracts, those ends are
drawn inwards, but when it is relaxed they rise to
their natural position.

With regard to the serrate, the longissimus dorsi,
and the pectoralis muscles, it is probable that they have
nothing to do with the expansion of the chest. For
il the hand be placed on these muscles when we
suddenly apply all our strength to dilate the thorax,
it will be found that they neither harden nor draw
together at all; yet this would happen if these
muscles underwent contractiori.

Besides the aforesaid muscles, the diaphragm also
contributes to the expansion of the chest, and indeed
ordinary inspiration seems to be mainly caused by it.
In expiration the diaphragm being in diastole, and
released from constriction and ina flaccid condition,
is pushed upwards into the region of the thorax by
the stomach and the other viscera contained in the
abdomen3 whence it is that it compresses the lungs
and diminishes the space in the chest. But in
inspiration the diaphragm is in systole, and con-
tracted, so that it no longer remains greatly curved
