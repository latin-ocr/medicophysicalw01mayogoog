but is carried downwards and outwards as it flattens.
So that the viscera ol the abdomen, which were
previously contained in its concavity, are, now that it
has contracted, forced both downwards and outwards,
and the space in the thorax which was previously
occupied by the diaphragm and the said viscera is now
left lree lor the expansion of the lungs. And indeed
any one can feel in himself that the ribs rise in
inspiration‚ while the viscera of the abdomen move
both downwards and outwards under the pressure of
the diaphragm. But all this will be more evident
from an autopsy, lor is the chest ol any animal is
opened and the diaphragm pressed downwards by the
hand while the ribs are pulled upwards (and this is
not done without much exertion)‚ you will see that the
chest dilates and that its capacity is enlarged. But as
soon as the supporting force is withdrawn, the chest
will of itself contract anew. For the diaphragm‚
pushed by the viscera in the lower part of the
belly‚ will soon rise into the cavity of the chest, and
the ribs‚ by descending forcibly to their natural posi·
tion, will still further diminish the cavity of the
thorax.

Hence if the stomach be too full, or if the liver or
the rest of the viscera are much enlarged, respiration
cannot gnon except with difficulty, inasmuch as the
said viscera, from their mass, press so much on the
diaphragm as to prevent it from descending and
enlarging the cavity of the chest. Still is, owing to
an urgent necessity for more vigorous breathing‚ the
violent contraction of the diaphragm forces the
abdominal viscera downwards, notwithstanding their
resistance‚ it not infrequently happens that its fibres
contract too much in consequence of the violent
suain, so that their tone is almost destroyed and
