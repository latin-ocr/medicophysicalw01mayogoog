On Respiratr'on 197

respiration goes on afterwards with difficulty. This
. happens not infrequently in the horse when driven
furiously immediately after a rather full meal. For,
since there is need of more vigorous breathing

when great exertions are made, and the diaphragm, “

for the wide dilatation of the chest, strives to
descend further than usual, while the much dis·
tended stomach resists its movement, it comes about
that its nervous libres suffer not a little and are some-
times even broken. And hence when the breathing
of a horse is injured in this way it is often, and not
improperly, said to be broken. But when the
diaphragm is thus weakened, respiration is carried on
exclusively by means of the intercostal muscles, for
these, when violently contracted, raise the ribs in a
notable manner and enlarge the space within the
chest, so that the defect of the diaphragm is to some
extent supplied.

Similarly in Orthopnoea‚ in which the patient can
only breathe in an erect position, it is probable that
the abdominal viscera press too much on the
diaphragm and keep it up in the chest, so that space
enough for breathing cannot be provided in the
thorax. If, however, the patient be placed in an
upright position, the diaphragm, feeble though it be,
aided by the weight of the same viscera, can force them
downwards. And so, as the abdomen sinks, the chest
dilates and the patient is able to breathe.

And quite similarly in the hysteric passion, when
the organs in the lower part of the belly, convulsed
and swollen, rise ina mass, and keep the diaphragm
up. respiration must necessarily cease and suffocation
follow, as it does. And it is reasonable to think that
this is the cause of uterine suffocation, although I
would not deny that the sympathy between the
