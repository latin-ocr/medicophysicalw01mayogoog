manner. When the diaphragm, whether owing to
the pressure of the swollen viscera of the lower part of
the belly or in consequence of its own wealrness, is
unable to contract and descend, and the thorax is ι
therefore dilated only by the movement os the ribs,
it comes to pass that the lungs, inflated by inspira·
tion, cannot, because of the resistance of the
diaphragm, attain their usual well-balanced position,
and their lobes are necessarily bent divers ways ; and
so the bronchia are bent and sometimes greatly
twisted so that the air cannot pass freely through
them, but, striking against them, will produce, as it
does, the sound and whistling. And hence it is that
this sort ol affection sometimes comes on suddenly
after taking flatnlent food or drink.

Hiccup has also a claim to be reckoned among
convulsive inspirations, for in it the diaphragm is
contracted by violent but interrupted and often
repeated systole, so that, in consequence ol its con·
traction, the chest is suddenly dilated and, the air
rushes violently and not without noise into the lungs.
For it must not be supposed that hiccup is produced
by the movement of the stomach, but by that of the
diaphragm. For the stomach when seized by con-
vulsion by no means produces inspiration, as happens
in this affection. Further, when the stomach is
convulsed, the parts about it contract inwardly, as
we can experience in vomiting, but in hiccup the
abdomen is forced outwards, and this, as we have
shown, arises from the contractiori of the diaphragm.
Yet since this ailment usually affliots a too full or
otherwise burdened stomach, we must suppose that
the stomach, or rather its upper orifice which is
attached to the diaphragm, is first affected, and that
