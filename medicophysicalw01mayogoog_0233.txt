the diaphragm from its nearness and relationship
takes on the convulsive movement.

It seems to be different in the case of that
oppression at night, with difficult respiration, which is
called nightrnareÍ¾ for this state seems to be produced
not by a convulsion of the parts about the thorax but
by an impediment to the proper influx of spirits.
This oppression generally attacks those who are
falling asleep. For when sleep begins, the spirits
which are the instruments of voluntary functions,
retire towards the cerebrum, or at least no longer flow
copiously from it. Meanwhile the spirits which have
for their office involuntary actions and natural
movements issue in continual flow either from the
cerebrum or from the cerebellum. If, however, in
consequence of any confusion, or from morbid matter
causing disordered movement of the spirits, those of
the latter kind as well as the former, while sleep is
coming on, return towards the brain and are detained
there, not only voluntary, but also natural actions are
necessarily interrupted by the flow of spirits being
impeded. Hence the actions of the heart, the thorax,
and indeed of the whole body cease, so that the
patient is necessarily affected with the very greatest
oppression, suffocation, and a kind of immobility.
That this motion of the spirits is in the wrong direc-
tion may be inferred from this, that the parts of the
body, first those more remote frorn the brain and
then those nearer to it, are gradually seized witha
certain stiffness and weight in consequence of the lack
of vital spirits. Meanwhile the spirits, detained in
the brain and moving irregularly there, produce a
feeling of giddiness and a disordered imagination.
But when the paroxysm ceases, the spirits rush-
ing impetuously from the hrain usually excite a
