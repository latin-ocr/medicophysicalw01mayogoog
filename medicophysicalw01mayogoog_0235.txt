supposed, drawn upwards when contracted by
repeated irritations. For in systole and in its con-
traction‚ it is drawn downwards, as shown above, and
so causes inspiration rather than that expiration
which takes place in laughter. From what hasbeen
said it is evident that risibility is peculiar to man not
because the nerve of the diaphragm communicates iu
man, but not in beasts, with the cervical plexus, and
by means of it with the hrain—an opinionwhich the
learned Dr Willis has maintained in his boolton the
- Anatomy rp‘the Brutia. For laughter does not take
place because the diaphragm, on account of an
instigation brought by the said nerve from the brain,
contracts violently with repeated throbs and com-
presses the lungs, as this learned man supposed. For
it has been shown that laughter does not proceed

· from the action or systole of the diaphragm, but, on

the contrary, from its diastole.

We have spoken thus far ol the manner in which
respiration takes place, and it now remains lor us to
inquire into its use. This is indeed a most difficult
affair, for there is not more accord as to its necessity
than doubt as to its use.

For not only is air inspired useful lor tasting and
smelliug, and expelled, lor talking, shouting, cough-
ing, sneezing, and spitting, and again, when retained,
for the expulsion of urine and faeces, for parturition,
and for moviug on the chyle, the lymph, and the
blood; the breath we inspire is destined for astill
nobles use: from which arises such a necessity of
drawing breath that we cannot indeed live a moment
without it.

Some suppose that respiration chiefly serves sor
cooling the beart, but heating rather than such a
cooling seems to suit the circulation and fermentation
