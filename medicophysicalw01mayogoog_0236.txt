On Respiratiou 203

of the blood. Nor indeed is the more frequent
respiration in violent exercise for the purpose of
cooling the blood which the motion heats. For in
violent exertions‚ be they so momentary that the
blood is not much warmed, there is certainly need of
more intense respiration than in the greatest state of
heat, and in fevers, that is when the blood boils more
and is as it were on fire; so that respiration will be
seen to serve not so much for cooling as for motion
itself‚ as will be shown afterwards.

But the prevalent opinion is that respiration is
necessary to life in order that the blood may be able
to pass through the lungs from the right ventricle of
the heart into the lef . For the foetus in the uterus,
whose blood does not pass through the lungs but
through special ducts, does not need to breathe at all.
’ And this they say is the reason why there is not the
same necessity for breathing in the uterus as after
birth.

But there is uo reason why we should say that
Nature has constructed the lungs with so much skill
and labour only that the blood may pass through
them after birth, since it might pass by a shorter and
much less obstructed road through the same channels
it follows in the unbom foetus. Nay, it is the case
that the blood can pass through the lungs apart from
their motion. For if blood or any other liquid is
injected by means of a syringe into the pulmonary
artery of a dead animal it will pass readily enough

into the left ventricle of the heart. And indeed any '

one can feel for himself that although respiration be
temporarily suspended, yet the pulse of the arteries in
the wrist is strong enough. But this would not be
the case if the blood were not passing at the moment
through the lungs to the left ventricle of the heart.
