And this will be made still clearer by what is to be
said below. Still Ι will not deny that the movement
ol the lungs, and the compression of the blood-vessels
occasioned ¹by the fall of the thorax in expiration,
contribute not a little to send the blood through the
lunge, but it is by no means to be supposed that this
is the only use of respiration.

Hence some think that respiration serves a further

purpose, that of churning, forsooth, and dividing into
the smallest particles the thicker venous blood. For
otherwise (as they say) the blood would be separated
into distinct parts, namely, serum anda purple sedi-
' ment. But neither is this the chief use of respiration.

For any air, however impure, would suffice for such
a movement of the lungs and for the churning of the ⁸

blood; but air vitiated by contagion, or air which has
often been sent out from the lungs, is byrro means
suitable for respiration and the support of lif . With
respect, then, to the use of respiration, it may be
affirmed that an ae'rial something essential to life,
whatever it may be, passes into the mass of the blood.
And thus air driven out of the lungs, these vital
particles having been drained from it, is no longer fit
for breathing again. But-this will be made clearer by
the following experiment.

For if, by means of bellows attached to the trachea
- of an animal, a dog for example, the lungs are in-
flated, but in such a way that, through openings
made here and there at their extremities, some of the
air may pass out, the loss of which must be supplied
by the bellows that the lungs may not collapse; in
this case,I say, the animal will live. And yet that

Ι sort of agitation of the blood cannot take place in

lungs which are kept inflated to the utmost. More-
0ver, though the movement of the lungs entirely
