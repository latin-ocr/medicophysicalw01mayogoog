ceases, yet the blood is transmitted through them to
the left ventricle of the heart. But if, on the other
hand, the mouth and nose be closed alter breath is
taken and drawn into the lungs‚ death will certainly
follow, although the lungs remain inflated, because
expiration is prevented. And yet the passage os the
blood through the lungs is as ready in this case as in
the other; for the comminution of the blood cannot
be greater in the former case, since in both cases the
lungs are equally distended-a clear proof that
respiration is not necessary either for the passage of
the blood through the lungs or for its agitation. But
the reason that an animal lives in the one case and
dies in the other is that in the former there isa
continual access ol fresh air, but none in the latter.

As to expiration, it should be noted that it serves
the further use that, along with the air driven out
from the lungs‚ the fumes which are raised by the
fermentation of the blood are also blown out.

Let us now inquire what the aerial element is
which is so necessary to lile that we cannot live sor
even a moment without it. And indeed it is probable
that certain particles of a nitro-saline nature, and
these very subtle‚ agile, and in the highest degree
fermentative, are separated from the air by the action
of the lungs and couveyed into the mass of the blood.
For this aerial salt is so necessary to every form of
lile that not even plants can grow in soil to which air
has not access. But if such soil be exposed to the air
and impregnated anew with this fertilising salt, it will
again become suitable for the nourishment ol plants.
So that even plants themselves seem to have a kind
of respiration and the necessity of absorbing air.

But it is not so easy to understand the function
which this aerial salt exercises in animal life, yet it is
