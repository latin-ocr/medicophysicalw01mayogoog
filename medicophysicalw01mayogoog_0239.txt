probable that nitro-aerial spirit, mixed with the
saline-sulphureous particles of the blood, excites init
the necessary fermentation. And yet it is not to be
supposed that this effervescence oi the blood takes
place in the heart alone, but that it goes on first in
the pulmonary vessels and afterwards in'the arteries
no less than in the heart. ForI do not recognise
that ferment,I know not what, in the leit ventricle
ol the heart. For whence and by what vessels is
there so great an influx of it as would suffice for
heating so often every day the whole mass of the
blood? In the loetus the blood to a great extent
passes directly from the right ventricle of the heart
into the aorta, and yet this ought not to be done if so
necessary a fermentation took place in the leit
ventricle. Much less probable is it that the beating
of the heart is caused by the rarefaction of the blood
in its ventricles as the famous Descartes supposed.
Foris the pulsation of the heart were caused by the
fermentation of the blood in its cavities, then, when
the heart beat, its ventricles would be greatly dilated
by that blood, just as a bladder is blown into the form
of greatest capacity. And indeed the blood would
not rush forth so impetuously in the systole as in the

â€™ diastole of the beart, and not from an impulse derived

from the contraction ol the beart, but on account oi
its own rarefaction. But we know in fact, from
vivisections, that the ventricles of the heart are con-
tracted when it beats and are not dilated by the
rarefaction or explosion ol the blood, and also that the
blood rushes out when the heart contracts but not
when it relaxes. Indeed, if a motion similar to that
which takes place in systole is excited in the heart of
a dead animal, filled with water or any liquid, the
liquid contained in it will immediately rush forth, not
