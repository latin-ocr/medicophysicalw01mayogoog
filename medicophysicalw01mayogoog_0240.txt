On Respiratabn 207

indeed because of an explosion (for of course there is
no such thing in this case) but because the ventricles
actually contract. And further it is obvious that the
movement of the heart is not caused by the rarefaction
of the blood, because hearts are sometimes observed to
beat after being cut ont even if the blood has been
pressed out of their ventricles. Indeed, if a solution
of opium or cold water be injected through the
jugulat vein, the bearing of the heart will immediately
become more frequent, as Ι have often observed, but
this cannot be caused by a more frequent heating, for
heating is greatly hindered by substances of that
kind.

So that obviously the heart seems to be nothing
but a muscle, differing but little in its action from
other muscles, and we must believe its function to con-
sist in contraction alone ¹and the expulsion of the
blood.

But although nitro-ae'rial particles excite fermenta·
tion in the mass of the blood, I do not know whether
it is owing to the want of thern that the blood,
immediately upon respiration being checked, becomes
so thick that it is quite incapable of motion, and
stagnates in the left ventricle of ‘the heart. For the
blood while not yet impregnated with airis sent
readily enough from the right ventricle, and indeed
the left ventricle differs from the right in no other
respect than in the greater power it possesses of

driving out the blood even if it be thicker. And yet
it is not to be denied that nitro-aerial particles ’
condnce not a little to the fermentation and, conse·
quently, also to the fluidity of the blood, as was said
elsewhere. But, you will ask, how is it then thar
death follows so soon upon breathing being arrested
if the blood is not rendered incapable of motion?
