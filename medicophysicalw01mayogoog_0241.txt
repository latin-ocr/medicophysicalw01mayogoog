There is certainly yet another use of respiration to

be looked for, one that makes it so necessary. And ἵ
whatI have thought out on so obscure a matter ‘1 shall-...4
shortly state.

Life, if I am not mistaken, consists in the dis·
tribution of the animal spirits, and their supply is
most of all required for the beating of the heart and
the flow of blood to the brain. And it appears that
respiration chiefly conduces to the motion of the
heart in the manner to be stated elsewhere. For it is
probable that this ae‘rial salt is altogether necessary
for. tol the museles; so that without

Foris it be allowed that the su
the muscles results from the intermixture o ι “icles
of different kinds, mutually moving each other,
it is scarcely to be supposed that the particles of both
kinds, by the effervescence of which the contraction of
the muscles is caused, proceed from the mass of the
blood; sor liquids derived from the same source re·
unite without any effervescence, so that it appears
that something extraheous is required for the pro-
duction of the motive fermentation.

We may then suppose that uitro-saline particles
derived from the inspired air constitute the one kind
of motive particles, and that these, when they
meet the others, the saline-sulphureous particles

· supplied by the mass of the blood and residing in the
motor parts, produce the effervescence from which
muscular contractiori results, as xwill be shown more
fully in another place.

And in fact motion is produced in the heart in no
different way than in the other museles; but 1 do not
think, for thereasons assigned above, that the motive
effervescence takes place in its ventricles but in its
