muscles

Wherefore on the suppression ol respiration, as
that ae‘rial salt required for any motion lails, the
beating of the beart and, consequently‚ the flow ol
blood to the brain will necessarily be interrupted and
death will ensue. But one may live lor a certain
time without breathing, because the blood contained
in the pulmonary vessels and sufficiently impregnated
with air is capable of moving the heart at least for a
moment.

And this use ol respiration can be further confirmed.
For in exercises and violent movements there is need
of more intense and more frequent respiration, not so
much that a greater flow of blood may pass freely
through the lungs-lor we have shown that this can
take place when respiration stops-but because there
is a great expenditure of nitro-aerial salt in conse·
quence of the various effervescences made in the
contractiori of the muscles; so that the venous blood
returns -to the beart now much impoverished and
thick (and we know that this also happens after
convulsive movements in epilepsy). Wherelore, that
the effete blood may repair the waste, there is ol all
things need ol more intense respiration. Resides an
acceleration ol the heart's beat is necessary in violent
movements on account of the more copious flow of
blood; but this can scarcely be effected without freer
supply of nitro-aerial particles—especially since the
blood is now effete. So that a main use of respiration
⁸ clearly appears to be to set up the motion of the
muscles and especially of the heart. Hence the frog
which is accustomed to live under water for some
time without respiration will go on living, even when
· its beart is cut out3 but to animals which require a ¹
