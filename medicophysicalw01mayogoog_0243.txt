continuous supply of spirits and consequently an
uninterrupted movement of the heart, continuous
respiration is altogether necessary, since without it
the motion of the beart ceases.

Furthermore, if after the motion of the heart has
ceased from the stopping of respiration, air is blown
in through a tube fitted to theomarum, we shall see
the heart’s motion re-established. So that it appears
that air is that without which the movements of the
heart cannot go on at all. Nor does it matter much
how the air is transmitted to the mass of the blood,
whether by the lungs or by any other way.

To this l add, lastly, that it is proved by Boyle’s
experiments that flies, bees, and other insects which
can move with half of their body after being cut
through the middle, can yet neither move nor live in
a place void of air. To these small animals that have
neither blood, nor hearts‚ nor lungs, at all events not
in their divided parts, air seems to be needed for no
other purpose except motion alone. Finally, accord-
ing to this hypothesis, it is easy to say whence the
beasts ol burden that exercise nearly all their muscles
the whole day long, derive an adequate supply ol
explosive material for so great an amount of work;
for what the entire mass of the blood is inadequate to
supply, the air, that freer fountain, can provide in
abundance.
