ΟΝ ΤΗΕ RESPIRATION OF
THE FOETUS IN THE UTERUS
AND IN THE EGG

Srvcn the necessity oi breathing is so essential to the
sustaining of life that to be deprived of air is the same
as to be deprived oi the common light and the vital
spirit, it will not be out of place to inquire here how
it happens that the ioetus can live though imprisoned
in the straits of the womb and completely deprived
oi the accessos air. For it is not enough to say that
the blood oi the child is brought during the period of
gestation through the foramen ouale and the ductus
arteriosuS, and circulates well enough without the
movement of the lungs‚ while the mass oi the blood
takes its course, after birth, through the lungs‚ which
it cannot traverse without the help of respiration.
For respiration serves another purpose than trans·
mitting the blood through the lungs; otherwise the
lungs would be altogether superfluous, since the blood
could have been carried round by another passage as
is done in the uterus. Nay‚ the blood can pass
through the lungs themselves without the aid oi

respiration‚ as has been pointed out elsewhere.
