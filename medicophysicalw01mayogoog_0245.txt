minutes only, will die immediately after its breath is ’
stopped, this is not because the movement ol the
blood is prevented3 for the blood could be carried
round by the foramen avale and the ductus artembsus,
since these passages, to which it is accustomed‚ are
not yet closed.

Itis therefore to be absolutely concluded that the
necessity for breathing arises from this, that certain
nitro-aerial particles requisite for the support of life
are transmitted by means of the lungs into the blood,
as I consider to be established by what is stated
elsewhere. And therefore inasmuch as the foetus
cannot breathe in the womb, as the air is excluded, it
is necessary that the lack of respiration should be
supplied from another source.

For we cannot agree with those who maintain that
the foetus breathes even in the womb—a view upheld
on the strength of the vagitus uterz'nus and the ructio
infantuli. But indeed it seems to me that air can
just as well pass to the blood, without respiration,
through the skin and veins, as penetrate the closed
uterus and the many membranes which enfold the
foetus. Although I would not deny that vapours
arising from the fermentation of juices are perhaps
sometimes contained in the ammon, and these may
produce the vagitus uteribus and the suetae, but they
cannot serve the purpose ol respiration, since they
would need to be driven out oftener from the lungs ol
the embry0. Indeed, for the suetz'o zizfantulz, there is
no need at all that air or vapours should be contained

in the amnion, sor the external air, by compressing
and pushing not only the outer parts of the body, but,
by their intervention, all the internal parts alsn, and,
consequently‚ the liquids of the amnion, is able to
cause suction in the uterus. ' ’
