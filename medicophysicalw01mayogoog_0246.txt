On tte Remiratzon of the Foetus, etc. 213

ι With regard‚then, to the respiration of the foetus in

· the womb, we may suppose that the semina] juice

which exudes from the membranes of the uterus, or
from its caruncles‚ not only supplies nutriment to the
child but also makes up for the want of respiration.
And indeed it is probable that the umbilical arteries
are formed principally and perhaps exclusively for the
sake of respiration. Indeed I know no other purpose
for which they should be fashioned by Nature in every
foetus with such wonderful care and skill. I am
aware of the diversity of opinion that exists among
authors as to the functions of the umbilical arteries,
but I do not know whether among the numerous
offices hitherto assigned to them their true and
peculiar office is to be found.

According to Adrian SpigeliuS, the umbilical
arteries convey the blood from the foetus to the
exterior parts, that is, to the secundzizoe, for their
nourishment. But in fact it is evident if we look at
a hatched egg that the membranes (which in the egg
correspond to the secundinae) are formed while the
umbilical arteries are not yet indicated, from which
we may infer that the said arteries are not formed for
the sake of the membranes. Resides, the umbilical
arteries are so notable in the egg at the very
beginning of life, and their offshoots are connected in
so wonderful a network‚ that there can be no doubt
that they contribute, in no small degree, to the
formation of the foetus and to the starting of the
dance of life. To this Ι add further that the
secundina are sometimes in excellent condition
although the foetus is quite corrupt, which is indeed
a very probable indication that the secundinae draw
nutriment rather from the mother than from the
foetus.
