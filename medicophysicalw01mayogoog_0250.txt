On the Respiration of the Faetus, etc. 217

almost infinite number of little bubbles and into a
much greater bulk than before, a sufficiently clear
proof that certain ae'rial particles are most intimately
mixed with these liquids. To which 1 add that the
humours of an egg when thrown into the fire, give
out a succession of explosive cracks‚ which seem to be
caused by the air particles rarefied and violently
bursting through the barriers which confined thern.
And hence it is that the fluids of an egg are possessed
ol so fermentativea nature. For it is indeed prob-
able that the spermatic portions of the uterus and its
carunculae are naturally adapted for separating a'e'rial
particles from arterial blood.

These observations premised, we maintain that the
blood of the embryo, conveyed by the umbilical
arteries to the placenta or uterine carunculae, brings
not only nutritious juice, but along with this a portion
of nitro-adrial particles to the foetus for its support3
so that it seems that the blood of the infant is
impregnated with nitro-aerini particles by its circula·
tion in the umbilical vessels, quite in the same way as
in the pulmonary vessels. And therefore I think that
the placenta should no longer be called a uterine livet
but rather a uterine lung.

Should any one object here that such a mode of
breathing in the uterus could be carried on without
umbilical arteries‚ since it would suffice il the
nutritious juice were to pass, charged with nitro-aerial
particles, to the foetus through the umbilical vein,I -
answer that to supply the'part ol respiration there is
need of a continuous supply ol air, but that the
nutritious juice should not be in such abundance as to
come to the child in a perpetual stream, and therefore
it is necessary that the umbilical arteries should be
so formed, that the arterial blood, continuously sent
