out to the placenta, may be there impregnated with
a portion of nutritious juice charged with aerial
matter; and that it should return thence, with never
interrupted motion to the foetus, sor the purposes at
once of nutrinrent and ol respiration.

For indeed it is probable that if arterial blood,
which is imbued with nitro-aerial spirit, came to the
heart instead of venous, there would be no need at all
for respiration. And this seems to be confirmed by
the fact that when arterial blood, in what is now a
well-known experiment, is transmitted from one dog
to another, the dog to which the blood is transferred,
although previously panting and breathing violently,

yet, after receiving the arterial blood, seems scarcely
to breathe at all.

OF THE RESPIRA TION OF THE CHICK IN THE EGG

Thus far of respiration in the uterus ; it remains for
us to discuss brieily the respiration of the chick in the
egg. For there can be no doubt that the want of

’ respiration in the egg also is supplied from another

source. It is in fact our opinion that the chick in the
egg respires through the umbilicus very much in the
same way as the child in the uterus. For when I
contemplate the really marvellous and complicated
network oi the umbilical arteries in the incubated
egg, and then consider that none of the things
essential to animal life are wanting in the egg, except
respiration only, assuredly Ι can arrive at no other
conclusion than that the aforesaid vessels are formed
to compensate for the lack of respiration.

Wherefore, let us now inquire how the umbilicus
in the egg supplies the place. ol respiration. In
