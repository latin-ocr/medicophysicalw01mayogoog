Let us also ponder briefly whether the gentle
warmth produced i'n the egg by the heat of the
incubating fowl does not contribute in some measure
to compensate for the want ol respiration. For it
was elsewhere shown that nitro-aerial particles are
detached from the aeria} particles by the fermentation
of the blood, and that these, in animab, serve the
purpose of respiration. Further, it ought to be
noted that heat ol all kinds is produced by the
motion of nitro-aerial particles.

But now as it is altogether needlul lor the genera·

wise, why should we not suppose that nitro· ''flal
particles (from the communication of which to t
egg its warmth arises) supply to some extent the
place of respiration in the egg? Certainly the nature
of the white of egg seems to be such as is suitable
for the detention and entanglement of nitro-aerial
particles, inasmuch as it consists of a viscid fluid, and
that, too, impregnated with saline particles liberated
from union with sulphureous particles. It corro-
borates this view that the white of an egg, if whipped
rapidly with a rod or spoon, becomes frothy more
than all other substances on account of the abundant
intermixture with it of atirial matter. It is therefore
probable that nitro-adrial particles‚ when conveyed to
the egg by the warmth of the incubating fowl, are
detained there by its albugineous humour; and that
when at last collected by the almost innumerable
ramifications of the umbilical vessels and then
brought in great abundance to the foetus, they
compensate in some degree for the wantos respiration
in the egg. For the chief use of the respiration
of animals is to introduce nitro-atirial particles
