into the mass oi the blood, and it does not matter
how this is done. And indeed the tepor produced in'
the egg by the warmth of the incubating - fowl
produces the same effect in its primogenial juices as
the nitro-aerial particles do in the mass of the blood.
For just as the nitro-aerial particles passing into the
earth along with heat and molstum, effervesce with
its saline-sulphureous particles, on which action the
life and respiration of plants depend‚ as has been
elsewhere shown, and as nitro-aerial particles densely
mixed with the blood through the agency of the
lungs excite the fermentation required for animal life,
so also the same nitro-aerial particles entering the
juices ol the egg under the form of a geuial heat
appear to contribute to some extent to set up in them,
vital fermentation and animal movement, and so ina
measure to perform the part of respiration. And
hence it is that the tepor, whether produced by
incubation or in some other way„ is so necessary for
sustaining the life oi the chick in the egg. For if an
¹egg is opened alter some days of incubation, in such
away that the salient point comes into view, you will
find that according as the egg is exposed to heat or to
cold, the little heart ol the chick is beating in the
one case, and in the other languishing and ceasing to
move as if respiration were suppressed.

From what hasbeen said it is not very difficult to
understand how it is that theletus, il wrapped in its
unbroken membranes, can live lor several hours alter
birth without danger of suffocation ; while yet if it has
once taken air into the lungs after being stripped of
its membranes, it will not be able to survive for a
single moment without air, but will, immediately die,
as has been recorded by the illustrious Harvey. It is
not enough to say here that the blood⁴ of the infant,
