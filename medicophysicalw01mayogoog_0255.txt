222 Mayow ’

after respiration once begins, is taken round by an
entirely new path through the lungs, and that it
cannot be transmitted through them without their
contiuuous movement. For I think it is clear from
what has been said that this answer fails to remove
the difficulty. It should rather be said, I think, that
the albugineous juice contained in the placenta, or in
the membranes in which the foetus is enclosed, have
a supply ol nitro-aerial particles large enough to
continue for a tirne the respiration and the life of the
infant. Indeed‚ the foetus when born and wrapped in
its unruptured membranes, seems to be in nearly the
same case and to breathe very much in the same way
as the chick enclosed in the egg. If, however, the
foetus is stripped of its membranes, and contracts the
muscles of the chest aud the diaphragm that respira-
tion may begin-certainly no small exertion—there is
now a greater expenditure of nitro-aerial particles for
muscular effort‚ and consequently the foetus is under
a greater necessity to breathe‚ since nothing is any
longer received to supply the want ol respiration.
It will not be irrelevant to inquire here whether
the air which is contained in the cavity in the blunter
end of every egg contributes to the respiration of
the chick. This cavity lies between two membranes

. which are stretched over the whole interior of the

egg. For ol these membranes, the one which is next
the shell is in all parts firmly attached to it, but the
other, which is next the fluids ol the egg, adheres
almost everywhere to the first, except that by reced-
ing from ita little at the blunt end of the egg, it
forms the aforesaid cavity there. Harvey and others
have supposed that this cavity lies between the
membrane which envelops the fluids and the shell,
which is left bare at that place by the other
