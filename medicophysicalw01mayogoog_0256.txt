On the Respiration of the Faetus, etc. 223

membrane, but Ι have ascertained that the shell of
the egg is everywhere lined by the first membrane
and that the cavity lies between the two membranes.

With regard to the purpose served by the air
contained in this cavity‚I cannot agree with the
learned Fabricius who maintains that air is stored in
it sor the respiration of the chick; for there is so
little of it that it would barely suffice for once
starting respiration. BesideS, the air enclosed in the
cavity is completely shut out from the foetus by the
intervening membrane, so that it cannot pass to the
foetus for the purpose of respiration, as will be evident
from the following experiment. For let the sharper
end of an egg be so broken that its fluids can be
poured out in order that the said cavity may be seen,
which in eggs that are not yet hatched will be very
small. Then let the egg be put into aglass and the
air pumped out by Boyle's pump.

When this is done the small portion of air con-
tained in the cavity will at once expand when the
pressure of the atmosphere is withdrawn, in virtue of
its elastic force, and will push forward the membrane
covering it a long way, so that the cavity will enlarge
to half the size of the egg, more or less. Nay, the air
sometimes by separating the said membrane from the
other to which it was previously attached, will push it
beyond the cavity of the egg, And from this we may
infer that the air cannot pass through the lining
membrane and be conveyed to the chick, for if it did,
this membrane would not be pushed so far by the
enclosed air nor become distended.

But since that air within the egg cannot reach the
chick lor the function of respiration, let us inquire
what purpose it serves. For itis by no means to be
believed that the air which Nature has so carefully
