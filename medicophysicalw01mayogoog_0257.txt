placed in every egg is altogether useless and super-
fluous. But in order to understand the function of
that air, it must first be noted that the seminal juices
of the egg when colliquated by incubation are not
rarefied or expanded‚ but are on the contrary con·
densed and forced into a narrower space than before.
For we remark that the aforesaid cavity is greatly
enlarged after a few days’ incubation‚ as will be
manifest if the blunt end of the egg is perforated.
But this would not at all be the case unless the juices
which filled nearly the whole of the egg before
incubation were subsequently, by the incubation,
condensed and made to oceupy less space than before.
In fact the humours of the egg are contracted after
they have passed into the body of the'chick, to about
a half less than they were at first, since the cavity
enlarges under incubation to about half the size of the·
whole egg.

But now let us consider briefiy how it is that the
juices of the egg are condensed to such a degree by
incubati0n; and it is to be noted that things may be
condensed in various ways:
⁸ 1. If vacant spaces numerously interspersed among

the particles of vthe thing to be condensed are
diminished or even removed by the particles
approaching each other. But it is not probable that
the juices of the egg are condensed in this way only.
For it is by no means to be believed that as much
empty space should be distributed among the juices of
the egg as is required for contracting them to the

extent of about one half. For if such were the case
the juices of the egg would eontract very much on
account of the pressure of the atmosphere when the
shell is perforated. Yet this does not at all take
place.
