On the Respiratzbn of the Faetus, etc. 22 5

a. A thing will undergo condensation if its particles
which have expanded on being set in motion are
afterwards, on the subsidence of the motion, reduced to
narrower space. But neither in this way are the juices
of the egg condensed, inasmuch as they are colli-
quated and fermented by incubati0n‚ so that the motion
of their particles is necessarily greater than before.

3. A thing might be condensed if some more subtle
matter interposed among its particles extricated itself,
so that the parts of the thing might approach nearer
to each other. And indeed it naturally occurs to one
to say that the rarer part of the albumen exhales,

and that the juice is reduced in consequence to less
¹ bulk than before. But, indeed, this cannot happen in
the egg, because its very compact shell and also the
membranas enveloping the juices of the egg, prevent
any part of these juices escaping out of the egg, especi-
ally since in the incubated egg a greater space than
before is provided for the reception of these juices.

4. Condensation of a thing may take place because
some elastic matter distributed among its particles
becomes afterwards less elastic 3 and it is especially ln
this way that the juices of the egg seem to be con-
densed. For it is probable that the air distributed
among the juices of the egg loses its elastic force on
account of the fermentation produced among these
juices by incubation, just as takes place in the mass of
the blood, as has been shown above.

Since the seminal juices of the egg become more
contracted in this way by incubation and are reduced
to smaller bulk than before, there would be a vacuum
in the incubated egg if prudent nature had not, to ⁵
avoid this, stored in the egg a small quantity of air
which by its elastic force might extend itself into the
space left vacant by the condensation of the juices,
