And hence it is that the said cavity is so much
enlarged by incubation. For we must not suppose
that this enlargement ol the cavity is produced by
the access of new air, but by the pressure ol the air
inside. For although when the blunter end of the
egg is perforated, the said cavity is found to be much
larges than in new-laid eggs‚ yet il the sharper end is
broken and the juices oi the egg poured out, the
membrane spread over the cavity (which, by the con-
traction of the juices of the egg and by the elastic
force of the air, was thrust far into the region of the
egg) will immediately fall back, on account oi the
pressure ol the external air introduced into the
perforated egg, and be applied anew to the shell; so
that the cavity will not now appear larger than in
unhatched eggs‚ unless perhaps the air enclosed in it
be still warni and rarefied‚ in consequence ol the
warmth of the incubating lowl—a clear enough proof
that the enlargement ol the cavity is due to the
elasticity of the air inside, in virtue of which it
expands into and occupies the space left by the
contractiori of the juices.

Nor yet is it to be supposed that precaution is
taken against a vacuum in the egg, as though nature,
according to the common belief, abhorred a vacuum,
but rather because a vacuum would not be so suitable
for the generation ol the chick. And indeed it is
reasonable to think that the air stored in the egg, in
consequence of its elastic force (increased not a
little by the fostering warmth of the incubating fowl)

gently compressos the colliquated juices ol the egg
and drives thern into the umbilical vessels, and hence
contribules not a little to the commencement of
animal motion.

It is, moreover, likely that the air inside the egg
