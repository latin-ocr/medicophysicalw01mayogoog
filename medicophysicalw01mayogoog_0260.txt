On the Respiration of the butus, etc. 227

contributes still more to the growth of the chick and
to the building up of its structure. For it should be
noted that the seminal juices of the egg, colliquated
from the beginning of the incubation, formed a fluid

body, and that, therefore, among their particles flow-
ing hither and thither, there must have been inter-
sperseda great number of little spaces. But when
the primordial particles go combined together into
various parts, they compose no longer a fluid but a
solid body, such as is that of the embry0, and, what
is to be chiefly noted, the particles, becoming much
more compact‚ are brought into a smaller space, as
was remarked above.

But since the air enclosed in the egg is always
compressing the primogenial juices by its elasticity,
that tends to bring it about that the seminal particles,
united most closely together, are reduced to the
smallest possible space. And this result is at last
attained when the particles adapted for forming this
and the other parts mutually embrace each other and
pass into the body of the embry0, since the primo-
genial juices, when converted into the body of the
chich, are reduced in bulk by about one half. So
that, clearly, that internal air, by compressing and
pushing the primordial juices of the egg, appears to
perform the same work as the steel plate bent round
into numerous coils by which automata are set in
motion.

And, lastly‚ it is also to be noted, that when the
juices of the egg are forced into smaller bulk by
incubation in the manner aforesaid, the shell of the
egg would scarcely be strong enough to resist the
pressure of the external air, unless that internal air,
its elasticity in no small degree increased by the heat
of the incubating fowl, supported it.
