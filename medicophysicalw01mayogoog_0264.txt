given, spring forth from the tendinous into the fleshy
libres, and there, meeting active particles ol another
sort, supplied by the blood, immediately eff ervesce with
them, so that from the struggle and agitation ol them
both, the fleshy libres, being lax and porous, are stuffed
out and corrugated, and that the contraction of the
muscle is produced by the corrugation at the same
time at both ends of all these libres. But when the
contraction is over, the unused spirits that are left
again in great part retire into the tendinous fibres,
leaving the other particles within the fleshy fibres, Ι
and then the blood, as also their nerves repair the
waste of these fibres. But as to how the spirits stored
in the tendinous fibres are brought thence into the
fleshy libres for the production of motion,’' our learned
author supposes “that an impulse transmitted by the
nerveS, as it were a token, is required, and that this
is done by other spirits sent from the brain, while,
namely, these inflowing spirits, by their varying
approach to the muscles, regulare the innate spirits in
their various movements, whether of expansions or of
retreats.”

This theory of the learned author is certainly very
ingenious, but Ι am not sure that it is in the same
degree in accordance with truth.

For, in the first place, the inflation of the fibres in
the way described is beset with various difficulties,
and these of no small weight. For if a muscle is cona

tracted by the inflation of its libres, it would neees-
sarily follow that, being distended towards the outside
in its contraction, it would swell into a much greater
size; but it has been found by observation that a
contracted muscle is drawn more closely together and
becomes hard, and that, if it does not become smaller,
yet certainly it does not swell up to such an extent as
