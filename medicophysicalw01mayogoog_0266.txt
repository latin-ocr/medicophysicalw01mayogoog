On Mascular Motr'on and Animal Spirits 233

undergoes contraction, it is probable that not so much
the libres, as the fibriis inserted transversely into them,
chiefly undergo contractiori, as will be shown after-
wards

As to the swelling of the fleshy libres observed close
toa ligature tied upon thern, that seems to be pro·
duced by the blood passing through on theone side
and on the other, but not from the interrupted motion
of the animal spirits. For if such a swelled libre be
wounded, blood immediately escapes in abundance.
Resides, that tumour remains constant at the ligature
even when the muscle is relaxed and is no longer
contracted, and then the animal spirits are not sup-
posed to advance out ol the tendinous fibres, but, on
the contrary, to retire into them.

But so farI think we may agree with the learned
author, forI believe that the contraction ol the
muscles is produced by particles of different kinds
mixed with one another in the structure of the muscle,
and mutually effervescing, as will be shown below.

1 am quite aware that the learned Dr Steno, in his
Myologr‘ae Spectmen, published not very long ago,
thinks that there is no need that any elastic matter
should be added in order to start the contraction of
the muscles; which, in this learned author's opinion,
can be effected by a mere change ol their form.
Thus, “If a muscle should change from an oblique·
angled parallelogram into a parallelogram the angles
of which are less acute, as is supposed to happen in
the contractiori of the muscle, then it will be con-
tracted in length, and will also swell up, without the
addition ol any new matter '’ ; as is shown in Plate 111,
Fig. 1, in which, let a, b, c, d, be the muscle, c, d, a,f,
the same contracted, and although it be ol the same
magnitude as before, and has had no new matter
