added to it, has yet undergone contractiori as to ·
length, and besides, rises at f into a tumour. But,
indeed, it is hardly to be believed that muscular fibres
should be ready to start this sort of motion unless
some new matter were added for that end ; for, as the,
structure of an uncontracted muscle is lax, it would
seem that the fibre b, d, in its contractiori should not
be carried outwards towards f, but rather, on the
contrary, should go inwards. Again, if the contracted
muscle is of the same size as before, and if no new
matter has come to it, how is it that in its contractiori
it becomes so hard and tense, as any one can find out
in himself by placing his hand on a contracting
muscle? And finally, what indeed could contract the
fibres and cause a change of this sort in the muscle if
nothing flowed into it? N ay, it is quite evident that
some new matter brought by the channel of the
nerves is required for starting the contractiori of the
muscle, inasmuch as, if the nerve distributed to a
muscle be cut, the contractiori of that muscle becomes
impossible.

1 confess, for my part, that if we concede the arrival
of new matter for accomplishing the contraction of
the muscle, its contraction can be produced by a
mere change of its shape; as will be seen in the figure
referred to, in which, when the musele a, b, c, d, is ,
inflated by the motive influx, it necessarily follows
that the fibres a, c, and b, d, are brought towards a
position at right angles to the tendon c, d, which we
assume to be fixed, and that the other, the more
mobile tendon, is drawn outwards so that the inflated
muscle will be c, d, e, i. For that muscle could, by
no other change produced in it, be enlarged for the
reception of new matter and be thus inflated. But
while the muscle is thus changed as to shape, it
