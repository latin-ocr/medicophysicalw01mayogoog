swells as to breadth, but becomes less as to length;
and in this way a muscle can be shortened, although
its libres suffer no contraction.

But whether a change ol this kind takes place in a
muscle‚ and its contraction depends on this alo11e,I
shall not say for certain. Still, it does appear to me
that a contracted muscle does not swell up so much as
would be required if its contractiori were caused in
this way. Besides,l do not see what part oi the
mnscle should sustain the attack ol the motive matter
in such contraction‚ for some kind ol membranous
vesicles, rather than muscular cords‚ would be suitable
lor bearing the force ol connection, and yet the
strength of a muscle seems to proceed from its fibrils
and cords rather than from any kind of vesicles or
'membranes But these things will be discussed more
fully below.

CHAPTER ΙΙ

Α SHORT DESCRIPTJON OF MUSCLES. ALSO WHAT
PART OF A MUSCLE PRIMARJLY CONTRACTS

In the anatomical dissection ol muscles the first thing
that presents itself is a membranous integument spread
in all directions over each muscle; under which come
into view series of fleshy fibres; these, parallel among
themselves, are inserted obliquely into the opposite
tendons‚ which are parallel one to the other, as the
eminent Steno first observed.

Next, there corne to view the wonderful series ol
almost infinite membranous fibrils, which, parallel
among themselves, cut the fleshy libres obliquely, for
