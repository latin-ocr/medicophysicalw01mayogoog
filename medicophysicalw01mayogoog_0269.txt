indeed, just as the fieshy fibres are inserted into the
tendons, so are the fibrils into the fleshy fibres, but
arranged the contrary way; and as the fibres closely
joined together seem to form the tendons, so the
collection of fibrils seems, in part at all events, to
form the fibres themselves3 as is seen in Plate 111.,
Fig. 2, which shows the series 01 fibres and of fibrils‚
as they are seen in muscles that have been boiled for
asufficiently long time.

Hitherto it has been held by the authors best
acquainted with anatomy that the fleshy fibres of the
muscle chiefly and primarily undergo contraction; but
in our opinion (which I should wish to express with
all respect) not the fibres but the fibrils inserted trans-
versely into thern, take the chief part in musculas
contraction‚ and this we gather frorn indications which
are at all events probable. For if the contractiori
took place in the fleshy libres, then, for a due contrac- ·

fibres should be much more shortened than the
muscle itself; for as the libres are not arranged
according to the length of the muscle‚ but are inserted
obliquely into the tendons, as may be seen in the
figure referred to, it follows that the contractiori 01

fibres ; and that for a proper contraction 01 1110 muscle

it would be necessary that the fibres should be con· ·

not think such a great contraction 01 the fibres really
occurs in motion: for, besides that we cannot in
vivisections see this sort of contraction 01 1110 {ibren if
the fleshy fibres contracted so much, the muscle
should swell enormously‚ but it does not.

Resides, in order that the contraction of the rnuscle
should be effected by the fibrils, there is no need that
