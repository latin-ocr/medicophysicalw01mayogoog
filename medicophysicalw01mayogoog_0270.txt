On Muscular Motion and Anzbzal Spiritu 237

they should contract and swell up so much, inas·
much as their series are, as is shown in the figure
referred to, arranged according to the length of the
muscle, so that the contraction of the muscle will be
equal to that of the fibrils. But now, as nature is in
the habit of taking the shortest road‚ it is probable
that the contraction of the muscle is produced by the
contractior] of the fibrils rather than by that of the
libres. And it also tells in favour of this, that, as the

, fibrils are very small and very short, their contractior] ·

even to a half would scarcely be anything remarkable ;-
for as the fibrils suffer contraction as a whole, the case
· is just as if fibres stretched according to the length of
the muscle were forced into manifold corrugations,
and their contracti0n‚ taking place thus, although it
be pretty great, can yet occur without notable swell-
ing of the muscle.

To these l further add that the shortened fibrils
draw the fleshy fibres together and constrict thern: so
that it is probable that the contraction of the muscles
is accomplished by the fibrils; inasmuch as amuscle
when. contracted is conspicuously constricted and
becomes hard; and it does not seem that this could
take place in any other way than by the contraction
of the fibrils. But there will bea fuller discussion of
the constriction of the contracted muscle later.

Moreover, it is nature’s custom very often to carry
on her operations by means of very small things so
that the fibres seem too thick and coarse for muscular
contraction to take place primarily in them; and it is
probable that they serve rather for transmitting blood
than for carrying on animal motion, as will be shown
below. ,

Lastly‚ it tells in favour of this, that the shortness
of the fibrils aud their almost infinite number con-
