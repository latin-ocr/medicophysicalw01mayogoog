tribute to the strength of the muscles and to the
more effective performance of their pull. Certainly
the fibrils, whether we consider their number, their
size, or their position, would seem much more fit for
bringing about muscular contraction than the fleshy
fibres. And this is further much confirmed by actual
inspection3 for, so faras I have ever been able to
attain in examination by vivisections,'the fleshy fibres,
in the contractiori of a muscle, as if attracted by the
transverse fibriis, seemed to come nearer one another,
and not to be themselves shortened, but to follow the
contractiori of the fibrils.

As to the fact that, in consequence ol a ligature
being tied round each end of the fleshy fibreS,
muscular contraction ceases and the fibre itsell does
not, as it otherwise would, swell up, as has been noted
by the eminent Dr Willis, 1 think this due to the
interruption, by means of the ligatures, of the motion
of the blood and of the animal spirits, an inflow of
which is necessary for the contractiori of the fibrils

fibrils. Let us now, in the next place, see by what
