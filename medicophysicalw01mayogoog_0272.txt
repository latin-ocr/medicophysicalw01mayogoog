cause the contraction of the fibrils is effected. There
can beno doubt that the influx ol animal spirits is
necessary for the performance of the motive fonction,

Ι inasmuch as if a nerve is cut or obstructed, the

muscle to which it is distributed refuses to contract.
But it is not to be supposed that the contraction of
the muscles depends on the animal spirits alone, since
for carrying it out there is absolute need of other
particles besides, brought from the mass of the blood.
For, seeing that the arterial blood is supplied to the
muscles ina continuous flow, and, especially in more
violent movements, in a fuller flow than to other
parts or than is required for their nutrition, it may be
concluded that the arterial blood in its transit de-
posits something necessary for the contraction ol the
muscles. For, indeed, such is the structure of muscles
that in their contractior] they draw themselves
together, and thus greatly promote the motion of the
blood ; and that is why the motion ol the blood is so
much accelerated in rapid running. And we can
easily put this to the test, if, when the median vein
has been opened, the muscles attached to the forearm
are contracted (and this can'be quite well accomplished
if the fingers are pressed together in flexion), for when
this is done, the blood will be seen to rush out forcibly,
being pressed out of the said muscles by their contrac-
tion. But this so much accelerated motion of the
blood in contracted muscles does not seem to be
merely incidental, but to be arranged by the highest
wisdom ol nature, by which, namely, the motive
particles of the blood may be brought in passing to
the motor parts ; and when they have been deposited
from the blood, what remains of it is expelled with a
certain push by the constriction of the shortened
muscle, so that when the loss is repaired, it may again
