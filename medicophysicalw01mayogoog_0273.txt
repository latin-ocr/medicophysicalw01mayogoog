return with‘a new stote of motive particles. What ·

has been said is besides much confirmed by an experi-
ment made by the most ingenious Sten0; for it is
established by his observation that a muscle can by
no means undergo contraction if the artery distributed
to it be tied with a ligature so that the afflux of blood
to the muscle is prevented.

Indeed, I think that the chief use of muscular flesh
is that it may separate from the mass of the blood
certain particles necessary for the contraction of the
muscles. Indeed, we may point out that it is the
function of all kinds of parenchyma to separate by
way of filtration some' particles of a definite kind from
the mass of the blood, as is manifest inthe paren-

, chymata of the liver, the kidneys, and others of the

kind. It is therefore probable that the parenchyma
of flesh which is associated with every muscle, has
been constructed in order that by its means particles
of a definite kind, necessary for setting up the con·
⁸ traction of muscles, should be filtered out of the mass
of the blood.

But that the structure and use of muscular flesh
may be better understood, let us shortly inquire in
what manner the blood makes its way through the
flesh. For l do not think we should agree with those
who assume an extravasation of the blood. The
special ground for this opinion is that no nutrition of
the parts, so they say, could take place if the blood .
were always retained in its vessels, just as a river will
not fertilise the neighbouring meadows unless its
waters flow over its banks to irrigate them. But it

seems scarcely admissible that so confused a thing as
the extravasation of the blood should occur in the
animal economy, where everything is arranged with
such admirable art and order. Besides,l really can-
