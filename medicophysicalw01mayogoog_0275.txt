seems to be nothing else than an affusion of blood,
which, when coagulated, adheres to these vesicles,
for, while the mass of the blood wanders like the
Maeander among these channels and glides past them
in its placid stream, the thicker particles are deposited
on account of the slackness of the motion, and adhere
to the sides of the vesicles, and yet, if the blood
circulate more quickly, they are carried away with its
impetuous rush, and hence it is that in the heat of
fever and in the more violent exercises, the muscular
parts are despoiled and become lean.

As to the use of the fleshy pare'nchyma, it is
probable that the aforesaid vesicles, along with the
sanguineous sediment adjoined to them, act as a filter,
by which the motive particles are separated from the
inass of the blood, as we have indicated above. And
it tells in favour ol this, that the parenchyma of the
flesh turgid with blood is compressed by the constric-
tion of the contracted muscle and hythe natural subsid-
enee of the parts Í¾ whence it comes about that the motive
particles are driven, as it were, by a powerlul squeeze
into the motor parts to carry on the function ol motion.

As to the nature of the motive particles separated
from the mass of the blood, it is our opinion that they
are of a saline-sulphureous quality. I think, namely,
that sulphureous and saline particles brought to the
highest volatility iu the mass of the blood by its
continuous fermentation in the manner elsewhere
described, and most intimately joined together, are
separated from the blood by the action of the
muscular parenchyma and stored up in the motor

parts for setting up their contractiori. For we may
note that no small loss of fat takes place in the
more violent exercises, and that it almost wholly
disappears in long-continued hard work3 while yet,
