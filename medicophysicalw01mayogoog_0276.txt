On Muscular Motion and Animal szrz'ts 243

on the other hand, animals indulging in ease and free
from hard work become very obese‚ and fat is dc-
positcd on their museles in quite sufficient abundance.
Whence we may gather that the sulphureous par-
ticles of the blood, of which the lat is formed, have
some share in the productiori of muscular contractiori.
Indeed, animals seem to be emaciated by hard work
just because the sulphureous and fat particles of the
blood are used up and consumed in muscular con-
traction, while yet if the motor parts have long ceased
lrom contraction the sulphureous particles are not now
spent in producing the contractiori of the fibrils,
but are carried away through special vessels into
suitable receptacles and, brought there in sufficient
abundance, constitute fat. But that the fatty par·
ticles are carried by special vessels, is proved by the
fact that the blood-vessels disseminated through the
mass ol the muscle do not extend to the fat connected
with almost all muscles, so that the sulphureous
particles composing the fat cannot come immediately
from the blood, but they must be brought by special
vessels from the inner part of·the musele3 and
certainly it has been established by anatomical obser-
vation that certain membranous vessels disperscd here
and there through the mass ol the lat are continued
into the inner parts of the muscles. It does not
seem likely that the fat thus stored in appropriate
receptacles returns to the motor parts, still it is not to
be by any means regarded as a useless excrement, but
as serving various ends, such as the support of delicate
parts and the lubrication of others. But these things
will be discussed more at length later. In the
meantime let us inquire as to the nature of the
animal spirits, the influx of which into the muscles is
also necessary for bringing about their contraction.
