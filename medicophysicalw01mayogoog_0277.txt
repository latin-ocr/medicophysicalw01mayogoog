THE ANIMAL SPIRITS ΒΥ WHICH MUSCULAR CON-
TRACTION IS PRODUCED CONSJST OF NITRO-
AE'RJAL PARTICLES. INCIDENTALLY, AS Τ 0 THE
MOTJON OF THE BRAIN

As to the nature of the Animal spirits, we may
conclude that they, so far at least as they contributa
to animal motion, consist of Nitro-aerial Spirit. But
that this may be more clearly understood, let us first
suppose that nitro-aeria} particles, which we have
elsewhere shown to be passed 'into the blood by
respiration, have also some share in setting up the
performance of motion, as has long been our opinion.
For, indeed, we have remarked a good while ago, in
our Treatise on Respiration, that animals in the more
violent errercises,¹ as when much urged in running,
find ol all things a necessity of very much increased
respiration, and the cause of this seems to be, that in
violent movements the nitro-aerial particles are separ-
ated from the mass ol the blood to set up the contractiori
ol the muscles and are used up, so that there is need of
more frequent respiration by which the blood may
repair its losseS, and have restored to it anew nitro-aerial
particles for carrying on the fonction of motion. For
the purpose of the increased respiration in violent exer·
cises is not that the blood coming in greater abundante
to the central organs and pushed on by the more fre-
quent collapse of the lungs, should pass through them
more easily, for in febrile heat, when, namely, the
blood circulates in a most furious whirl‚ the respiration
is nevertheless no more intense than usual: indeed,
it has been elsewhere shown that the blood can pass
