On Mascular Mation and Animal Spirr'ts 245

through the lungs although they do not move. Nor
is it, as some one might say, that respiration is
increased in violent exercise to cool the heated blood,
for it would follow from that thatin febrile heat,
when the blood is as it were on fire, there would also
be need of more intense respiration. And, moreover,
we have shown above that inspired air tends rather to
the heating than to the cooling of the blood, so that
it should rather be said that by the contractior] of the
muscles, often repeated in violent movements, the
blood is deprived of fermentative particles and in
some measure coagulated3 and that there is need of
more intense respiration for this reason, namely, that
the loss of the fermentative particles being again
repaired, suitable fermentation may be excited in the
blood. Hence, indeed, it follows that the nitro-aerial
particles, upon which the fermentation of the blood
depends, are separated from the mass of the blood in
violent movements‚ are spent in the contraction of
the muscles, and are lost.

From what has been said, we conclude that nitro· ,
aerial particles are necessary for the performance of
muscular contraction, and this will be still more
manifest from what follows.

Ι think it must be conceded that the motion
of the muscles is brought about by particles of
different kinds mixed with one another, for indeed I
cannot imagine how else animal motion could be
produced. For as to elasticity and weight, by which
automata are set in motion, neither of them can have
a place in the animal structure, inasmuch as motion
produced by them would soon come to an end.
Therefore it seems that we must conclude that the
motive function is effected by particles of different
kinds, mixed together, on the determination of the
