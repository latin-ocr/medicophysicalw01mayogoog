mind, and mutually agitated in most rapid motion.
And this is further confirmed by this, that for the con-
traction ol the muscles there is, as we have indicated
above, absolute need, not only 'of animal spirits,
brought by the nerves from the brain, but in addition,
of other particles supplied hythe blood.

Let us now consider, then, what is the nature of
those particles by means of which muscular motion is
effected. As to this, the most commonly accepted
opinion is that muscular motion depends upon salts
of different kinds, mixed together and mutually effer·
vescing in the motor parts. For indeed it is neces-
sary for setting up effervescence ol this kind, that one
ol these salts should be of an acid character, but the
other purely saline, fixed or volatile; but it is indeed
probable that an aeid salt never exists in the mass
of the blood except in case ol disease, inasmuch
as, when in astate of health, it is impregnated only
with volatile, or it may be acido-saline salt, such as
the ammoniacal salt. Besides, it is scarcely to be sup·
posed that an aeid salt has a place in the motor parts,
because all acids are directly hostile to the tender
and delicate structure of the fibrils, and they would
be much injured by an acid liquid poured on them.
F urthermore‚ when these opposed salts, of whatever
sort they be, come from the mass of the blood, what
would prevent them, mixed in the blood, from acting
on each other, and, as contrary salts do, destroying
each other? And to these considerations we may
add that the effervescence of contrary salts would not
by any means be suitable for the motor parts, inas-
much as contrary salts mixed together do not com-
bine without coagulation, but yet coagulation can by
no means be admitted in the very minute structure of
the fibrils. Nor should we omit to notice this, that
