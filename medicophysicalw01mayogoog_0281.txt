nitre, as far as its saline and aeid part is concerned, is
in any way opposed to the sulphureous particles of
the wine.

For, no doubt, just as the nitro-aerial spirit meeting
with terrestrial sulphur excites that fermentation in
which the motion and the life of vegetables consist‚
so also according as the same spirit, brought by means
of respiration into the mass of the blood and there
effervescing with the saline-sulphureous particles of
the blood, produces the vital heat and motion, as I
have elsewhere striven to show, it is probable that
animal life and the motive function are brought about
by the same particles more exalted and put in a
condition of the highest vigour. For indeed I think
that the nitro-aerial particles springing forth from the
brain into the motor parts effervesce there with
the saline-sulphureous particles meeting them, and
muscular contraction is caused by their mutual agita-
tion in the way to be stated below. And hence it is
that for keeping up animal motion it is essentially
necessary that there should never be a deficiency in
the mass of the blood of saline-sulphureous pabulum or
ol nitro-aerial particles; and by how much more
intensely the muscular contraction takes place, as in
the harder kinds of work, so much greater is the outlay
of nitro-aerial and of sulphureous particles, for the
repair of which not only is the respiration increased‚
but besides there must be taken in greater quantity
food filled with saline-sulphureous particles, Hence
those articles of food which contain abundance of
volatile salt and sulphur are specially fitted for restor-
ing the powers worn by long-continued labour.

From what has been said, we may seek the reason
why so intense a heat is excited in the motor parts by
violent exercise. That hearing is commonly attri-
