On Mascular Motion and Animal Spirits 249

buted to the motion of the body itsell, but indeed in
animal motion there is no such friction ol the parts
(from which alone heat arises) as could account for so
intense a fervour. We must, therefore, believe that
the heat ol strongly contracting muscles comes from
nitro-a'e'rial particles, at that time much agitatcd in
the muscles; as I have endeavoured elsewhere to
show that every kind of heat arises from their
motion.

I may here note by the way that the ancients, not
altogether without reason, supposed that the source
of vital heat was in the heart; not that a sort
ol szlyclmz'um, whatever that may be, constantly
flamed in its sacred cloisters‚ but that, inasmuch as
the heart is unweariedly at work in continuous labour
for keeping up the motion of the blood, the nitro-
ae'rial and the sulphureous particles effervesco con·
tinuously in its muscular part, and that by their
motion a notable hent must be produced.

Further, from the foresaid hypothesis a reason
can be deduced why the sweat given out in violent
movements is ofa saline character, and very penetrat-
ing. For the extremely subtle nitro-aerial, as also
the saline-sulphureous particles, by which when mixed
together the contractiori of the musclcs is produced,
when forced out along with the serous liquid, render
it acrid and very penetrating. The reason why the
sweat is acido-saline seems to be that the volatile salts
of the blood, intimately combined with sulphureous
particles, are partly brought to a liquid state by the
effervescence which takes place in the muscular
contractiori, in the way elsewhere described.

From what has hitherto been said, it is to some
extent proved that muscular motion depends on
nitro-aeria} and saline-sulphureous particles mutually
