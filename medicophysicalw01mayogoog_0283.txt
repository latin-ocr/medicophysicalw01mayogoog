moving themselves in the motor parts. But now of
these particles by which muscular contraction is pro·
duced‚ some, viz. the animal spirits, are brought into
the motor parts from the brain by means of the
nerves; while others are supplied from the massot
the blood ; as we have shown above. Let us now see
whether the nitro-aerial particles are those motivo
particles supplied from the blood, or, on the other
hand, are those coming from the hrain—that is, the
animal spirits. On this point I was for some time
in doubt whether the nitro-a'e'rial particles go· im·
mediately from the blood into the motor parts; but
on serious consideration of the matter it seems more
probable that the motive particles supplied from the
blood are of a saline-sulphureous kind, as to some
extent appears from what has been said above:
whence it follows that the nitro-a'e'rial particles come
from the brain, and consequently are themselves the
animal spirits. Indeed‚ it is much more probable that
the nitro-aerial spirit should come from the brain
than that saline-sulphureous particles should do s0.
For sulphureous particles do not occur at all in the
hrain, whereas they are disseminated everywhere
throughout the mass of the muscles. Indeed‚ sul-
phureous matters seem to be hostile to the animal
spirits ; for, liquors full of volatile sulphur, such as
spiritui wine and the chemical oils of vegetables‚
when taken too quickly disturb the brain and
the animal spirits, and produce not only drunken-
ness, but not rarely maduess and fatal convulsions
While on the contrary the structure of the brain
seems to be such as to render it specially fit for
separating the nitro-aerial spirit from the blood and
for preserving it, as will be more fully stated below.
