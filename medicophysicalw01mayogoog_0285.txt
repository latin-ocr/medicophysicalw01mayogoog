flow ol the animal spirits or from their inordinate
motion, as will be more fully stated below.

For, indeed, nitro-aerial particles seem i'n a high
degree to fit the character ol animal spirits, inasmuch
as they are very subtle, elastic, and agile. For nitro·
adrial particles are suited lor eotering on very rapid ·
and igneous motion, as we have elsewhere shown.
The animal spirits are also of this sort: they pass in a
moment through the filaments of the nerveS, although
these have no visible cavity; and brought at last to
the muscles, cause their instantaneous contraction by
their own most rapid motion.

Further, the animal spiritS, like the nitro-aerial
particles‚ are so slender that they are at once dissi·
pated and leave no vestige of themselves. Ι further
add that nitro-aerial particleS, no less than the animal
spirits themselves, are necessary for the sustenance of
life. In fact it is difficolt to conceive why animals ’
should have such a necessity of breathing air, so that
not lor a moment can they live without it, unless
the nitro-aerial spirits had a primary place inanimal
life and were the animal spirits themselves. Hence,
according as there is need ol a greater abundance of
animal spirits, as io violent movements, oroi less, as
when the body is at rest, so nitroa'e'rial particles must
be supplied in greater or in less quantity, and this is
the reason why the respirationis so much increased in
violent movements.

Resides, whence, I would ask, is a supply ol animal
spirits 'sufficient lor continued work obtained unless,

Ι say, we call to our'aid the air, that inexhaustible ·

fountaio? For it is probable that animal spirits are
used up in the performance of muscular contraction
in much greater quantity than is commonly believed.
For I really do not know how a muscle could contract
