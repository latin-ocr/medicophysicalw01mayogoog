On Muscular Motion and Animal Spirits 253

itself with so much force, unless elastic particles were
present in sufficient abundance forits contraction3
and hence it is that in violent exercises the respira·
tion is so much increased that the great expenditure
of animal spirits made in motive effort may be re·
paired.

And not only lor muscular motion but also lor
sustaining life itsell, it seems that there is need of an
ample supply of animal spirits ς lor it is probable that
lile cannot be sustained without a certain series and
continuous flow ol animal spirits passing constantly
through the braio, or at all events through the
cerebellum. And that is the reason why, il the
respiration or the motion of the heart or of the blood
be stopped even ior a moment, the animal at once
dies. But more sully of this below.

ln confirmation of what has been said, there may be
adduced what the learned Malpighi has observed as
to the Respiration of Insects: viz.—Insccts which live
when their head is cut off, and the separated portzons ,ff
rehr'dz live, have pneumonic vessels distm'buted through
the whole duct of their spzizal marrow. For this
eminent man observed that the black points which are
to be found on each side of insects close to the spine,
are so many spicula or tracheae through which the
insects draw air ; insomuch that if the said spicula be
smeared with oil the animal soon dies from want of
breath. Further, he found out that some branches ol
the said tracheae are inserted here and there into the
spinal marrow.

But that we may apply these observations to the
present subject, 1 think we must allow that the
animal spirits in the more perfect animals are elabor-
ated only in the brain, and that they are dissemin-
ated from that source to the spinal marrow and to
