tion of animal spirits, and therefore the animal will
speedily die.

From these things Ι conclude that it is to some
extent made out that nitro-aerial particles, transmitted
by means ol respiration to the mass of the blood and
thence to the brain, arethe animal spirits themselves.
And this is in accordance with the lact that animals
placed in a glass vessel from which the air is exhausted
by means of Boyle’s air-pump, after a short time
perish miserably in convulsions. For the animal
spirits being deprived, by the removal of the air, ol
their due supplement, enter, as is their wont, upon
Ἰ disorderly movements, and rushing tumultuously into
the nervous system, excite convulsive movements,
and at last the animal dies lor want of air and of
spirits.

To these things 1 further add that those who suffer

from English consumption are very much weakened
and are almost destitute of animal spirits. And the
reason of this seems to be, that as their lungs are
wasting and flaccid, the nitro-aerial spirit is no longer
brought to the mass ol the blood in quantity sufficient
lor the preparation of animal spirits.

Nor should it be overlooked that in pestilential
diseases the brain chiefly suffers, and the economy
of the animal spirits is disturbed: lor in so lar aS, in
the spread of the plague, the nitro-aerial spirit is
tainted hythe poison, it must follow that the animal
spirits, composed of it, are out ol sorts.

At any rate nitro-aerial particles seem to be in the
highest degree suitahle for the preparation ol animal
spirits, for it is the nature ol spirits to be sometimes
inert and languid, and indeed on the other hand
sometimes very active and agile. Similarly the nitro-
