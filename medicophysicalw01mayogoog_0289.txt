aerial spirit is wont to assume diverse states, for at
one time it is in the most complete rest, and at
another with its greatest agility it enters on most
excited motion. For nitro-aerial spirit, when mixed
with sulphureous particles, is moved with most rapid
and sometimes quite igneous motion, but when
loosed from the company ol sulphureous particles,
it attains a state of extreme quiet, as we have else-
where shown.

Lastly, let us here note that the nature of the
brain seems to fit it in a high degree for collecting
and storing nitro-atirial particles, as the brain in
comparison with other organs lacks the sulphureous '
particles which agitate and waste the nitro-aerial
spirit; and that it has a sort of saline quality which
specially fits it for retaining the nitro-aerial spirit.

From this hypothesis of ours the reason may be
sought, why, above all other sensibles, light affects
the animal spirits, and, by exciting them to motion,
produces wakefulness, so that to induce sleep animals
must close their eyes and so shut out the external
light, while yet to the other sensoria the way lies
open for external objects even in sleep, For I have
elsewhere tried to show that light depends on the
motion of nitro-aerial particles disseminated through
the air. Therefore, as animal spirits consist ol nitro·
aerial particles, it comes to pass that they easily
follow the motion of the luminous particles which are
of the same kind as themselves. It tells also in the
same direction that the eye, when struck with a pretty
strong blow, seems to see a flame in front of it. For
it is probable that the nitro-aerial particleS, thickly
occupying the optio nerves, are excited by the violent
concussion to the motion requisite for the production
of light. But whether some animals, such as the cat,
