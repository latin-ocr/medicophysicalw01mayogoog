On Muscular Molion and Animal Spirils 257

can, at their own will, give a luminous motion to the
nitro-aerial spirits in the eye, I cannot certainly
decide: it is so far an indication of this that the cat
can use its sense of vision even in the dark.

lt is in harmony with the hypothesis stated above
that animals struck by lightning are not unfrequently
killed without any injnry, or vestige ol a blow. But
that the reason of this may be understood, Ι may
repeat here what 1 have elsewhere endeavoured to
show, vin, that lightning is caused by the nitro-aerial
particles diff used through the whole atmosphere being
thrown by the violent concussion of the air into a
luminous, and sometimes really igneous motion.
Wherefore, if nitro-aerial particles constitute the
animal spirits, it may sometimes happen that they
in the brain follow the motion of the nitro-aerial
particles forming the lightning in the air ; so that
the animal spirits would seem not so much struck
by lightning as themselves to form lightning. And
ι hence it is that they, being violently moved and as it
were set on fire, are dissipated in a moment; and so
on account ol the flame kindled in its brain the
animal, deprived ol the common light and breath‚
is extinguished. But this will be dealt with later. -

We may note here in passing that animals have
need of more intense respiration for some time after
violent exercise. The reason of this seems to be that
the blood returned from the brain to the heart is to a
great extent deprived of nitro-aerial particles, inas-
much as it had deposited some in the hrain and in
the cerebellum to supply animal spirits; whence it
comes about that no small part ol the blood goes
without its proper fermentation, because of the lack
of nitro-aerial particles, and is to some small extent
coagulated. For it has been elsewhere shown that
