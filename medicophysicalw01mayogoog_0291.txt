the fermentation and the motion of the blood are
caused by nitro-abrial particles. And this has also
been noted by the learned Dr Thruston. Where-
fore, for the proper fermentation and fluidity of the
mass of the blood there is need ofa more frequent and
a fuller respiration‚ even for some time after violent
movement. And from these things we may seek the
reason why the blood drawn during convulsive
paroxysms is usually very thick and somewhat
grumous For in'more violent muscular contractiori
there is very great expenditure not only of nitro-aerial
but also of saline-sulphureous particles (as it is on their
mutual action that the fermentation and fluidity of the
blood depend), and therefore the mass of the blood
must to some small extent be coagulated. But this
is especially the case when the parts which serve for
respiration suffer convulsion; for then, on account of
the nearly suppressed respiration, the loss of nitro-
a'e'rial particles caused by the convulsive movements
is not, as in other cases of violent movements, repaired
by respiration.

One might at first sight object to what has been
said above, that the animal spirits form a chief part
of the body, and that it is therefore likely that they
should be derived not from the air, as being something
external and foreign to the body, but rather from the
nobler particles of the blood, when these have been
brought to the highest subtlety and vigour: further,
that it does not become the admirable artifice of the
animal mechanism that it should be set in motion by
an external principle. Ireply that, of whatever sort
the animal spirits may be, they must certainly be
supplied from without. For that they should be
formed from the blood, as the mass of the blood is
daily renewed from food, spirits even arising from
