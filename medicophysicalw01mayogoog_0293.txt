by itsell for bringing the nitro-airial spirits to the
brain in ample enough quantity: wherelore I consider
it likely that the thicker menrirges which surrounds
the hrain undergoes a sort of pulsation, and that by
’ its contractiori the blood driven to the brain is
compressed; and that thus the nitro-aerial particles

are pressed out of the mass of the blood, and driven
into the hrain, in a way not very unlike that in which
the other motive particles are forced into the motor
parts by the constriction of the muscles. Such a
pnlse of the dura mater is confirmed by autopsy
itsell : for, in fracture of the skull‚ part of the hrain
comes into view, it is seen to rise in a tumour, and
immediately in turn to subside, which seems to be a
motion of the brain after the manner of the heart's
pulsation. For, indeed, when l consider the thickness,
the strength, and the nervous fibres of the dura mater,
Ι can imagine nothing else than that that membrane,
like all the otherS, is intended for the production ol
motion. 'For it is probable that the dura mater
behaves as another diaphragm by the help of which
the brain draws in nitro-aerial spirits and in a sense
breathes.

It is probable that the above described motion of
the mem'nges is natural, but yet that we can at will
increase its pulsation, just as we can that of the parts
which serve for respiration. And so by its diverse
motion various effects are produced in the bodies ol
animah, as is probable. For according asthat mem-
brane contracts itsell more strongly or more weakly,
the nitro-aerial particles, tle, the animal spiritS, are
driven in greater or in less abundance into the brain
and thence into the nervous system. Hence if a
supply oi animal spirits greater than usual is required
for carrying on more intensely the motive or the
