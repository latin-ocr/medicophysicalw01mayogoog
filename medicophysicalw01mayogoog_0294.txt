On Mascular Motion and Animal Spiritu 261

sensitive function, we need to constrict the head and
brain, as any one can find out in his own case: and
· that constriction of the brain seems to proceed to
some extent from the harder meningas contracting
itself more strongly. Certainly, in great anger, when
we strive to the utmost of our power to repel or to
avenge an injury, the said membrano, as il seized
with convulsions, seems to constrict the brain:
whence it happens that the nitro-adrial spirits, forced
into the hrain and thence into the nervous system,
produce certain involuntary movements and con-
vulsive tremors.

Ι further add that it is probable that sneezing is
produced by the dura mater contracting itself more
strongly, and lorcibly driving the animal spirits into
the nerves devoted to respiration; for it ἰεΝ certainly
established that the membranes ol the brain are
primarily affected in sneezing.

Further, Ι am not sure whether the pulsation of the
heart, or even the respiration, both of which are
periodic, do not depend on the pulsation of the harder
meningas surrounding the cerebellum.

Further, it may be held that epilepsy, as also
apoplexy, sometimes arise from the convulsion or
from the paralysis ol the said membrane : lor in these
diseases the brain itself is sometimes found free from
any sign of disease, and those substances which consist
of volatile salt and volatile sulphur, as oil ol amber
and such like, are specially uselul in these diseases:
for it is not to be supposed that the saline-sulphureous
liquids penetrate the brain itself and strengthen it,
inasmuch as sulphureous substances seem to be
hostile to the brain, and when taken too quickly, rushing
into the cloisters ol the brain not unfrequently cause
convulsions, as we have elsewhere indicated. But
