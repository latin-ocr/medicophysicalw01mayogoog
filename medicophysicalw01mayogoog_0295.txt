we may believe that the reason. why the said oils are
useful in these diseases is because they are specially
suitable for strengthening the motor parts and the
nervous fibres. For it has been found by experience
that those things which consist of volatile salt and
volatile sulphur are specially suitable for restoring the
fibres of the muscles to a proper tone. Whence it
comes that medicaments of that sort bring help to
the weakened and all but broken membranes of the
brain, and consequently afford very great aid in the
above-mentioned diseases.

But, to go a little further in our conjectures as to
the use of the said membranes, it seems probable that
sleep is caused by the membranes surrounding the
hrain, but not those surrounding the cerebellum, either
ceasing from their motion or at all events performing
it but remissly, so that the nitro-a'e'rial particles are
no longer carried into the brain, and thus the animal
functions are necessarily interrupted. For that a
need of sleep presses upon animals wearied with
labours is not, we must suppose, because of a want of
nitro-aerial particles‚ 2'.e.‚ of animal spirits, inasmuch
as a never-to-be-exhausted stock of them exists in the
air, but rather because the saline-sulphureous particles
of the blood have been consumed by watching and
work 3 but the deficiency of saline-sulphureous particles
concerns the motor parts but not the hrain, except in
so far as the meningas of the brain, which are to be
reckoned among the motor parts, refuse to perform
their pulsations if there is a want of saline-sulphureous
particles in the blood. Wherefore it would seem that
we should hold that sleep takes place because the
saline-sulphureous particles are so much consumed by
work and watching that, on account of their deficiency,
the menzirges of the hrain refuse to perform their
