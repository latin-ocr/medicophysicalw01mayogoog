movement. It certainly seems to have been arranged
by the good providences of nature that when the
saline-sulphureous particles are nearly exhausted by

vigils, what remains of these particles should be
reserved for the natural functioos-those really
necessary for life. Hence it is necessary that the
membrano surrounding the hrain should sometimes
cease from its motion, so that the small remaining
portion of motive particles should be employed for
the motion of the membrane surrounding the cere·
bellum, and the other natural functions. For it must
be noticed that although the spontaneous animal
fonctions which are performed by means of the hrain
are for a time interrupted during sleep, yet the function
of the cerebellum and the natural motions go on no
less, hay, rather better, when we are asleep than when
we are awake.

It goes to confirm what has been said, that when
we have recently awakened from sleep we feel our
brain turgid with blood and somewhat heavy. The
reason of this seems to be that in sleep, the membranes
of the brain ceasing from their pulsation, the motion
of the blood is not promoted by the contractiori of
the said membranes as when one is awake‚ and there-
fore the blood must be somewhat detained, and
stagnate in the membranes of the brain. But mean-
while during sleep the arterial blood, its passage
through the brain being to some extent obstructed,
’ is carried in greater abundance to the cerebellum3
hence the nitro-aerial particles pass in sleep in greater
abundance to the cerebellum and the nerves arising
from it, and thus it is that the natural functions
presided over by the cerebellum are better performed
in sleep than when one is awake. What has been
said also gives us a reason why, in diseases character·
