ised by sleepiness, rather remiss respiration suffices for
sustaining life. For in these diseases the respiration
seems quite suppressed, and the wretched patients
have not unfrequently been buried lor dead. For as
in such diseases the nitro-atirial particles are carried
to the cerebellum only, and thence to the nerves
dedicated to the natural functions, and even. then
natural offices are very remissly performed, it follows
that the expenditure of nitro-aerial particles is the
very smallest, and that for the reparation of this the
least trace of respiration suffices.

CHAPTER V

OF THE FERMENTS OF THE STOMACH, THE PAN-
CREAS, AND THE SPLEEN. INCIDENTALLY, OF
DISEASES WHICH HAVE REFERENCE TO THE
ANIMAL SPIRITS

Faou this hypothesis ol ours it is possible conveniently
“ enough to explain not only the effervescence set up
in the motor parts‚.but also how the fermentations
and concoctions of whatever sort are carried on in
the viscera of animals.

For, in the first place, as to the digestion made in
the stomach, the vulgar opinion is that there is in
the stomach a certain acid ferment. But whence
that aeid should derive its origin one cannot very
readily say, for anatomical observation establishes
that no aeid at all resides in a healthy stomach; and
as to aeid eructationS‚ they seem to corne from ill-
digested food and not from any natural acid liquid.
We have, then, to inquire how it comes about that
iron filings, taking in by the mouth, are corroded in
the stomach and turned into a sort of vitriol; and
