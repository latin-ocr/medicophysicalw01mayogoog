On Muscrtlar Motz'on and Animal Spirits 265

after taking chalybeate drugs a sulphureous and
vitriolic odour is perceived in the throat, such as
is usually produced from iron corroded by an aeid
liquid. Further, milk is coagulated in the stomach Α
as it is when an aeid liquid is added to it, and food
when eaten not unfrequently becomes sour. .
As to these things, I shall in the first place
assume that the digestion of food is effected by the

which there are many inserted in the stomach, and
that according as the animal spirits come to the
viscera which serve for digestion in greater or in
