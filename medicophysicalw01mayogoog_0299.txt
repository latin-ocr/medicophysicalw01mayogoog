2⁶6 · Mayow

scarcely any remain in the brain to perform the
voluntary functions and sensation, whence it is that
we can hardly keep awake.

But, now, as the animal spirits consist of nitro·
aerial particles, there will be no difficulty in under-
standing how the effects just described are produced
by them in the stomach. For although the nitro·
aerial spirit is not aeid, still iron is corroded by it
and vitriols produced, fixed salts are liquefied, and the
structures of things are dissolved as by a universal
solvent, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show.
lt therefore seems established that the muchsstalked·
of ferment of the stomach consists chiefly of nitro·
aerial particles, which, deposited in the membranes
of tlte stomach by the nervos, are probably there mixed
with a suitable liquid secreted from the blood by
means of the glandular membranes of the stomach;
and that the fermentative liquid of the stomach is
composed of both of them brought into its cavity
by special vessels And hence we may seek the
reason why serene and rather thin air so much tends
to sharpen the appetite and to promote digestion,
as has been found by common experience, while
when the air is thicker and loaded with noxious
vapours it soon produces discomfort in the stomach.
To these I further add, that from the swimming-
bladder which in many fishes has been found filled
with an a'e'rial substance, there is an open passage
into the stomach-certainly a probable indication
that something aerial conduces to the digestion of
food, as has been remarked by the learned Dr Walter
Needham. Indeed, as fishes take only a small
quantity of air out of the water, it would seem
necessary that the a'e'rial ferment should be stored in

some receptacle from which it may bc brought in
