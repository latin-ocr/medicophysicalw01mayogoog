sufficient abundance when required. l am not able
to decide certainly whether in terrestrial animals
als0, besides the nitro-airial spirits brought by the
nerves‚ an airial ferment may not in addition come
into the stomach directly from the mass of the
blood.

Ι conclude that the digestive liquid of the stomach
is not very different in kind from saliva; for saliva
seems to consist of nitro-aerial particles deposited in
the maxillary glands by the nerves and there mixed
with a serous juice derived frorn the blood: and that
it is to be believed that the saliva mixed in mastica-
tion with the food conduces not only to its deglutition
but also in no small degree to its digestion.

lf the stomach be quite empty of food, its interna]
membranes are, as is probable, pinched by the
nitro-a'e'rial particles, and hunger seems to arise from
this.

The food is concocted by the ferment of the
stomach into chyme‚ which, when it has passed into
the duodenum immediately meets the bile, by which,
as bya new ferment mixed with it, it is further
fermented and concocted. For as the bile is com-
posed of saline-sulphureous particles‚ it necessarily
effervesces in a high degree with the chyme, which
is full of nitro-a'e'rial particles; but to what ex-
tent bile partakes of a fermentative nature may
be gathered from this, that if it is mixed with a
farinaceous mass it raises it and ferments it, as has
been elsewhere stated.
