as it is probable that the nerves which are distributed
in great number in the pancreas‚ serve for carrying
nitro-aeria] particles, which, finding a suitable vehicle
secreted by its glands from the mass of the blood,
are passed into the duodenum by the duct of Vir-
sungus for the further fermentation of the chyme.
For when that pancreatic liquid, full of nitro-a'e'rial
particles, meets the chyme, imbued with bilious‚ that
is, saline-sulphureous particles, a very intense effer-
vescence must be excited ; and it is probable that
by means ol this the concoction of the chyme is
completed.

After these remarks as to the viscera had been
written, a treatise on the pancreatic juice published
by the eminent Ragnar. de Graaf came into my hands,
in which that learned man most clearly proves the
existence ol the pancreatic juice, and confirms the
use which I have assigned to it. But it is scarcely
credible that healthy pancreatic juice is of an acid
nature: noris it likely that the effervescence taking
place when that juice is mixed with bile in the
intestines is caused by the aeid salt of the pancreatic
juice meeting the fixed or the volatile salt of which
the bile consists, as is the opinion ol the learned
author3 for the effervescence of contrary salts does
not seem suitable to the animal economy inasmuch
as it comes quickly to an end and is always ac·
companied by coagulation, as has been stated above.
Further, any aeid salt mixed with a saline-sulphureous
liquid changes and destroys its saline-sulphureous
particles and coalesces with thern into an, as it were,
dead and insoluble calx, as in the preparation of
lac sulphuris, as also happens= in the case of bile
mixed with an acid liquid. And hence it is that aeid
salts are most suitable for allaying inordinate fermen-
