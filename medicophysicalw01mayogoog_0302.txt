tation of bile. While yet, on the contrary, in the
natural fermentation excited in the intestines, the
saline-sulphureous particles are brought to a just
volatility, as appears from the fetor of the dejections
and the inflammability of the flatus escaping from
the belly. Wherefore it is probable that the effer·
vescence produced when the bile and the pancreatic
juice are mixed together, arises from the working of
the nitro-aerial particles contained in that juice with
the saline-sulphureous particles of the bile, which
fermentation is fitted to exalt· the saline-sulphureous
particles of the bile, as we show elsewhere.

OF THE USE OF THE SPLEEN

Let us now, lastly, draw from this hypothesis of ours
a conjecture also as to the use of the spleen. If we
consider the wonderful structure of the spleen and
its notable size, and further regard the numerous
branches of nerves devoted to it, and its immense
supply of blood, we shall certainly conclude that the

spleen (which is to be found in all animals) serves
some general purpose. But it is an astonishing thing
that animals can live although their spleen is com·
pletely extirpated‚ and indeed bear its loss ¹without
any manifest inconvenience. Hence there has been
much discussion among anatomists as to the function
of the spleen; so that it might seem that this
troublesome organ had been made to harass the
minds no less of the physician than of those suffering
from it. For, indeed, nature has covered the spleen
more than other parts with blackness and darkness,
as if she wished to hide it and keep it in the dark.
Some have assigned to it a use so frivolous and mean,
