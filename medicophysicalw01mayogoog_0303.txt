that the indignant spleen could scarcely but burst
itself with laughter.

That my views as to the function ol the spleen
may be understood, Ι must repeat here what has
already been stated, via, that it is probable that for
sustaining animal life it is necessary that the animal ·
spirits, aa, nitro-aerial particles, should traverse the
hrain, orat all events the cerebellum, in continuous
series, and that that is the reason why on the suppres-
sion ot the respiration or on the interruption even for
an instant of the motion ol the heart, the higher
animals at once die.

If this is granted, it follows that the nitro-aerial
particles must be perpetually carried away again by
certain vessels; and, indeed, we may believe that the
nerves dedicated to the natural motions, and also
those belonging to the viscera, serve to carry away
the animal spirits from the cerebellum. But as for ·
natural functionS, particularly for the digestion of
food, there is need now of more and now of less
afflux ol nitro-aeria] spirits; while the nitro-aerial
particles pass through the cerebellum in a nearly
uniform fiow: it is, hence, necessary that the super·
abundant nitro-aerial particleS, those, namely, which
are not required for natural functions, should be con-
ducted elsewhere, and it is probable that the spleen is
formed in order that these superabundant nitro-aerial
particles should by means ol it be properly mixed
with the mass of the blood. For these nitro-aeria}
particles being discharged by the splenetic nerves
into the spleen are by its means, being diffused
through its parenchyma, most intimately mixed
with the mass ol the blood: whence it comes about
that an effervescence sufficiently intense but yet not·
too impetuous is excited by the nitro-aerial particles
