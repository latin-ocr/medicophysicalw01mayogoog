On Muscular Motion and Aminal Spirits 271

mixed abundantly but uniformly with the saline-
sulphureous particles of the blood3 so that the spleen
really seems to perform these three functions :-

1. That the nitro-aerial particles which pass in
continuous series through the brain, but are not
required for natural or animal functions, should be
’ carried into the mass of the blood and properly
mixed with it.

2. That the nitro-aerial particles may be brought
in suitable abundance and with a certain control to
the viscera devoted to the digestion of food. For
as these viscera are filled with food or empty, so they
have need of a greater or ol a less afflux of fermentative
particles,

3. That the nitro-adrial particles in a condition of
motion and vigour should, when most intimately
mixed in the substance of the spleen with the saline-
sulphureous particles of the blood, excite in the mass
of the blood such an effervescence as is fitted to

bring ’ its saline-sulphureous particles to a proper
volatility.

As to the former uses here assigned to the spleen,
the plexus and various communications among the
splenetic nerves and among those distributed to the
other viscera seem to confirm them. For by the
communications it is brought about that the nitro-

a'e'rial particles are brought to the yiscera serving
lor ¹the digestion ol food, and for other natural
functions now in greater and now in less abundance
as there is need, and what of the nitro-aerial particles
is over is turned aside into the spleen.

And in this we may seek the reason why, when
the spleen is affected by scirrhus, or obstructed in
any other way, the patient suffers from eructation
and hypochondriac flatus: for inasmueh as the nitro-
