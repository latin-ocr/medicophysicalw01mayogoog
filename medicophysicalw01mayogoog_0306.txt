On Mascular Motion and Aminal Spiritu 273

cerebellum and the nerves arising from it only gently
and with a constantly even flow; particularly in the

uterus, where, namely‚ the infant does not yet exercise
the respiratory organs. Whence it comes that the
splcen cannot be of any use, in so far, that is to
say, as the nitro-aerial particles traversing the cere-
bellum in a slender stream are almost all required
for the natural functions: but when the animal has
grown up and exercised itself in violent labours, it is
necessary that these nitro-aerial particles should be
transmitted through the cerebellum in greater
abundance‚ so that the nitro-aerial spirits may now
make for themselves sufficiently open channels in the
cerebellum, aud that the structure of the brain may
become more compact and firm, and sothe nitro-
ae'rial particles iu the future may more easily and in
fuller rush pass through the brain and the nerves
arising from it. But when these are not all required
for carrying on in the usual way the natural functionS‚
it is most necessary that the superabundance of nitro-
aerial particles should be discharged into the mass of
the blood and most intimately mixed with it by
means of some organ, such as the spleen.

I add, besides, that while the foetus is in the uterus,
the viscera devoted to the digestion of lood have
either nothing to do, or at all events act very remissly.
Whence it happens that the nitro-aerial spirits do
not go at all to these viscera, or at all events only in
very small amount3 and there is thus no need that
any part of them should be diverted to the spleen.
Further, as the infant immediately after birth takes
lood continuously‚ or at all events at frequently
repeated times, so that its stomach is to some extent
filled with food‚ and consequently the nitro-aerial
spirits ought to come t0 the viscera devoted to
