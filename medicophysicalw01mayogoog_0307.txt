digestion in an always even flow and without any
regularior, yet when the animal has corne to the
limit ol its growth it takes food at fixed periods,
and its stomach is sometimes filled with food and
sometimes nearly empty: and hence it is necessary
that the nitro-aerial particles should be carried now
in larger now in snraller abundance to the viscera ol
digestion. But that the afflux of nitro-a'e'rial spirits
to the viscera should take place under control, it is
necessary that there should be some organ in the
parenchyma ol which the excess of nitro-a'e'rial spirits

Ι may be deposited‚ as has been shown above.

As the primary fonction of the spleeu has no place
in infants‚ so neither is it necessary that its other
office, that is, the more intense effervescence of the
blood (which we have said takes place in the spleen),
should be exercised in infants. For it is probable
that the said fermentation excited in the spleen has

’ for its chief effect the bringing of the saline-

sulphureous particles of the blood to a proper
volatility lor motive and procreative fonctions, and
these fonctions do not well suit a tender age.

We gather from what follows that an effervescence
ol that sort is excited in the parenchyma of the
spleen by the nitro-abrial particles brought along the
nerves and mixed with the saline-sulphureous particles
ol the blood.

For it has been made out by observation that if the
spleen is obstructed by scirrhus‚ the mass of the blood
lacks its proper fermentation and becomes crude and
vapid, so that dropsy and chlorosis often result.
But Iconiess Ι do not know whence that fermenta-

tion excited in the spleen should arise, unless from
nitro-aerial particles along with the saline-sulphureous
particles of the blood; for 1 cannot agree with those
