who hold that the thicker and more fixed part of the
blood is detained in the substance of the spleen, and
that ir, by being long kept, acquires a fermentative
character3 foris particles of blood anywhere cease
from movement and stagnate, these particles will
prevent those immediately following from continuing
their motion, and thus, the circulation of the blood
being iu that part interrupted, swelling and inflamma-
tion will necessarily result. Moreover, the numerous
branches of nerves disseminated in the spleen seem
to serve no other purpose but that of conveying
fermentative particles.

Resides, as, when the fermentation in the spleen is
too remissly performed the blood becomes too crude,
so on the other hand if it is increased beyond a right
extent the mass of the blood acquires a somewhat ,
dried and atrabilious character. Indeed, as in lire
the nitro-aerial particles effervescing most intensely
with the sulphureous particles burn them up 'in an
instant and turn thern into smoke, as we elsewhere
show, so also if iu the parenchytna of the spleen
the nitro-aerial and the saline-sulphureous particles
work together too much, it comes to pass that these
particles become to some small extent dried up and
sooty, and from them, fixed in the substance of the
spleen, its dark purple colour seems to corne. But
that atrabilious diathesis of the blood may arise from
a.twof01d cause.

«1. 1r the saline-sulphureous particles of the blood
are detained in the spleen by reason of its paren-
chyma being obstructed ; for thus they, by effervescing
too long with the nitro-aeria] particles, become
torrefied and dried. Indeed the mass ol the spleen
seems to be composed of two kinds of vessels ; of which
oue, consisting of nervous fibres, is destined lor the
