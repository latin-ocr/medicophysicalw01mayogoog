formed inside the bodies of animale—in that chemical “
workshop of nature—into volatile salts. And the
same thing is indicated by the fact that if plants
which contain no volatile salt are allowed so far to
putrefy until they have been converted into worms,
then at last volatile salt can be obtained in abundance
from them by distillation.

As to the mode in which the fixed salts of the ’

food are volatilised, it is probable that the various
digestions and fermentations taking place in the
bodies of animals contribute in no small degree to
the volatilisation of the salts: indeed we may hold
that the spleen is the chief workshop in which
the nitrous salts of the food are worked up into
volatile salts. For, indeed, it is to be observed that
when vegetables are burned, their nitrous salts are
volatilised3 and they flying off along with sulphureous
particles, somewhat dried up, constitute the soot.
And soot abounds in volatile salt, although the
vegetables which, when burned, yield it, before their
deflagration, contained only fixed or nitrous salt.
And, as when nitre and sulphur are mixed together
and burned, as in gunpowder, it is probable that the
fixed salt, of which nitre in part consists, is volatilised
during the deflagration and flies off in the vapours3
for otherwise the fixed salt of the nitre would remain
after its combustion, for in the deflagration of nitre,
the nitro-aerial particles which it contains, set in very
swift motion by means of the ignited sulphureous
particles, most finely break up the saline particles
with which they were previously firmly combined,
and, as is probable, makes them volatile.

But if indeed the exceedingly impetuous and igneous
effervescence of the nitro-a'e'rial and sulphureous
particles suffices to volatilise in an instant the fixed
