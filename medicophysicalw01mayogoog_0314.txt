On Muscular Mation and Anzinal Spiritu 281

cause; for these symptoms seem in the said diseases
to come not so much from a deficiency of animal
spirits as from a disorder of the blood and of the
muscular flesh.

We may note by the way, that the slighter
convulsions, like those twitchings of the tendons
which trouble many in continued fevers, may to some
extent arise from a diseased condition of the muscular
flesh, in so far as not only the saline-sulphureous
but also the nitro-aeria] particles passing through the
now nearly wasted away parenchyma oi the flesh,
are transmitted into the rnotor parts, and by their
mutual effervescence the often slight contractions ol
the fibrils are, as is likely, produced.

From what has been said, the reason can be given
why bodily exercises are so useful in the icteric
disease and scorbutus‚ and also for warding off the
paroxyms ol intermittent severs. For in exercise the
nitro-aerial particles are sent in greater abundance
into the mass of the blood by the more intense
respiration‚ and the motion of the blood is much
promoted by the contraction of the muscles; whence
it comes about that the fermentation of the blood
is increased and it is comminuted and worked up.
F urther‚ the saline-sulphureous particles brought to
vigour are secreted from the blood and used up in
muscular contraction‚ and it is by their excess in the
mass of the blood that lebrile heat is excited‚ as has
been elsewhere said. '
