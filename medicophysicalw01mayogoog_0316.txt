affected by the heat of the lamp; but that con-
tractiori of the string is not produced in the common
way, but the string seems to undergo a spontaneous
movement, and to run together into itself in the
manner of fibrils-a very pleasant sight. But if the
contracted string be removed from the lamp it cari
be drawn out to its former length with very little
effort. As to the cause from which the contractiori '
of the string proceeds, we may believe that the nitro-
at'e'rial particles, bursting out of the flame of the lamp,
produce that contractiori of the string; for we have
elsewhere shown that igneous particles of any kind
(and it is by them that the said string is contracted)
are nothing else than nitro-aerial particles in a state
of motion. But the contractiori of the string seems
to proceed from its being twisted by the nitro-aerial
particles: for if one end ol the cord is left free, or if
it is held less firmly between the fingers and brought
towards the lamp, we shall see the cord rotated
pretty quickly. For as the nitro-aerial particles
bursting out of the lamp with the circumgyratory
motion proper to them act on the said cord, they
drive it round with their own motion and twist it.
And it is certainly probable that the contractiori
of the fibrils is accomplished in a not very dissimilar
way: for the fibriis, in which the contractiori primarily
takes place seem, iii as far as the microscope can
help us, to be very like an extremely slender music
. string. Resides, we suppose that the contractiori ol
the fibrils is caused by nitro-aerial particles set in
motion, and even pretty intensely warmed in the
motor parte. Wherefore‚ if a coarse and thick cord
undergoes contractiori when touched by nitro-aerial
particles, how much more should the extremely
slender fibrils, fashioned with the highest skill‚ follow
