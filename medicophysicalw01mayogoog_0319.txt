immovable tendon‚ it seems to me necessary that the
more movable end of the contracted libre, as also its
middle, should be moved towards the immovable end,
as is evident from the premises.

Therefore, as to the contractiori of the libres, oi the
fibriis, and consequently of the muscles, Ι think we
must hold that they by no means, of their proper
nature, contract towards the origin rather than
towards the termination ; but do so only because
what we call the origin is inserted into an immovable
part. So that if the bone into which the termination
ol the muscle is inserted should be more fixed than
that other one to which the origin is attached, then in
its contraction the muscle will be drawn towards its
termination. For example,·let any immovable thing
be grasped by one hand, and then the flexor muscles
of the forearm be strongly contracted (which will
occur if we make an effort to draw the thing grasped
towards us), in this case,l say, as the thing grasped,
being immovable‚ cannot be moved to us, the said
muscles in their contractiori will drag our arm and
our whole body which is attached to it towards the
thing grasped; so that it will happen that these
muscles in their contractiori will be drawn towards¹
their termination and not towards their origin3 inas-
much as the bone of the forearm in which the
terminations of the said muscles are inserted becomes,
on account of the immobility os the thing grasped,
the more fixed end: as is shown in Plate HL, Fig. 3, in
which while the flexor muscles ol the iorearnr, a, c,
contract‚ they do not as in other cases bend the
forearm but the arm; and in their contractiori carry
b, c, towards the terminal tendon, c.
