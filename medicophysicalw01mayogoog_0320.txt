Iu the last chapter we have spoken of the motion ol
contracting muscles in general, and speeially of the
flexor muscles. Let us now further consider more
closely how the diaphragm moves when it contracts‚
also in what manner the pulsation of the heart is

produced 3 and, finally, how the extensor muscles, by
means of which jumping is effected‚ contract.

⁴ First, then, as to the contraction of the diaphragm‚
although Ι have discoursed of it in my recently
published treatise On &spiratiam still there are some
things which may be added here.

In the first place, then, l affirm as indubitable that
if a curved surface‚ the circumference of which is on
all sides fixed to an immovable part, undergoes
contractiori, it will all round be carried towards the
immovable part, and the curved surlace will ap·
proximate to a plane but will never go beyond the
plane; as is shown in Plate 111.,Fig.5,in which let
l, a, c be the curved surface and b and c its fixed
ends. As it contracts it will be brought towards the
plane b, e, c. So that the contracted surlace b, d, c,
that is to say its middle point d, is nearer to the
