ends, b and c, than the middle point, a, of the surface
not yet contracted‚ but that surface, however much

contracted‚ can never go beyond the plane, b, c, as the -

line, b, e, c, is the shortest between the ends, b, c.
These things being granted, we assert that the
diaphragm in its contractiori is moved towards a
plane; in other words, when it contracts, it goes
towards the cavity of the abdomen, that is, outwards
and downwards. For it is known from anatomical
observation that the form of the diaphragm is curved‚
and that its concave surface or sinus looks towards
the belly; but now as any curved surface whatsoever
moves, in contracting, towards a plane, that is, towards
the region to which its concave surlaee looks, and as
the parts of the abdomen to which the concave
surface of the diaphragm looks are relatively to it,
inferior and exterior, it necessarily follows that when
the diaphragm, in its contraction, moves towards
thern, in its contracted state it goes downwards and
outwards. And besides, this can be seen in vivi-
sections by simple inspection. In this connection I
am much astonished that the eminent Dr Willis, in
his Answer to Dr Hr'glzmore, has expressed the
opinion, “ That the diaphragm in violent inspiration,
such as sometimes occurs in the case of dying
persons, descends beyond the plane and becomes very
convex towards the intestines.” For this does not
seem very likely: for it is not “possible that such a
descent ol the diaphragm should be caused by the
lungs taking a long inspiration,¹’ as the distinguished
author supposed, inasmuch as the inspiration and
the swelling of the lungs are caused by the descent
of the diaphragm and the dilatation of the chest.
But the lungs never causethe descent of thediaphragm,
but in all cases follow its motion, as we have else·
