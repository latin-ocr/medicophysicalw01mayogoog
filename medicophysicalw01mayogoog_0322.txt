where shown; and the diaphragm, in contraction‚ is
brought towards a plane but never recedes from it,
as appears from what has been premised.

Ι admit that in wounds of the chest or ol the
diaphragm itsell‚ the diaphragm is sometimes convex
downwards, but this does not occur in inspiration nor
does it arise from the lungs taking along breath; it
happens only in the contraction of the chest and in
*expiration For, indeed, in the dilation of the chest
gaping from a wound it has suffered, the air rushes
partly through the trachea into the lungs, but partly
also, by reason of its own elastic force, makes its way
through the opening of the wound into the cavity of
the chest; so that when in expiration the space of
the chest is suddenly diminished‚ the air contained in
the cavity between the lungs and the internal wall of
the chest‚ as it cannot at once escape through the
wound, compressed by the contraction of the chest,
pushes the diaphragm, which is in diastole and
relaxed‚ and pressing it downwards makes it convex,
as I have assured myself by inspection in vivisections.

It is to be further noted as to the diaphragm that
its fleshy libres proceeding from its membranous
centre‚ go out into the surrounding parts, into which
it is inserted: whence it comes about that as some
fibres stretched out in one direction, some in the
opposite, contract with equal effom, the membrane
between them is held in equilibrium: yet meanwhile
the diaphragm as a whole is carried downwards and
-outwards‚ just as if it had fibres stretched over the
whole of its length.
