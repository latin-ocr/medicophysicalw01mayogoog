OF THE PULSA TION OF THE HEART

As to the contraction of the heart, the distinguished
Dr Lower has given such an accurate description of
its motion, as also of its structure, that it is scarcely
possible to add anything to it. That the heart is
really a muscle, and that the contraction of its fibres

¹ diminishes the space of its ventricles and drives out

the blood, is quite indubitable. But here we come ’
across a by no means small difficulty ε for seeing that
the heart is contracted and becomes smaller in its
systole, how is it that at that very time it strikes-
the left side of the chest? For it would seem that
in its contractiori the beart should rather move in·-
wards and further from the wall of the chest. ⁴

Hence some have supposed that it is not the heart*
but the great artery, distended with blood, which
strikes the chest. But in fact the great artery, soon
alter its origin, turns backwards towards the spine,
so that its pulsation could not be felt outside. Nor
can we say that the auricles of the heart in their·
contractiori strike the thorax, because they, just like·
the heart, become smaller in their systole, and
besides, their deeper position is less suitable for·
striking the chest.

And lastly, we cannot believe that the apex of the
heart impinges on and strikes the thorax, because of'
its vibration and jump; for I have found from
vivisections that the pulsation of the heart is produced
by its ventricles swelling up into a tumour: in lact, if·
the thorax of a dog be quickly opened, and a finger,
or the hand, be placed on the left ventricle ol the·
heart, you will feel the ventricle swell up with ajump-
and strongly strike the hand or the finger placed on ,
