it. lndeed, if the finger be held at some distance from
the left ventricle, when the heart contracts the side
of that ventricle will be briskly dashed against the
finger. And that this is really the case has already
been remarked by the eminent men, our own
Harvey and Lower.

Harvey held that this kind of pulsation of the
heart arises thus: that while the walls of the
ventricles contract as to length, they must increase in
thickness, just as when other muscles contract they
swell up, becoming broader. Ι admit that the walls of
the ventricles of the heart do in contractiori become
somewhat thicker, but it is scarcely credible that they
swell 'up sufficiently to account-for the pulsation
against the chest3 for it hasbeen made out that
muscles do not in their contractiora swell up so much
as is commonly believed.

Ithink, then, that we should hold as to the pulsation
of the beart, that the fibres of the heart, in their
contraction, draw its cone towards its base as to the
more fixed end; whence it comes about that the
walls of the ventricles are carried outwards, the
pressure of the contained blood contributing to this.
To this it may at once be objected, with Harvey.
that a curved fibrc in contracting becomes straighter
and is not distended in a circle, and so as the walls
of the ventricles of the heart are in a circular position
they will be carried inwards towards a straight line,
and not outwards. I reply, if both ends of the curved
fibre were fixed, it would, when shortened, be brought
towards a straight position ; but if one of the ends of
the fibre be movable, and even is in fact moved,
it can, in its contraction, be distended circularly: for,
in Plate 111, Fig. 9, let a, i, b, be a curved fibre, or the
internal wall of the left ventricle of the heart, and a, e,
