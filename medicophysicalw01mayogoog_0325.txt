the septum of the heart. Now, I say, inasmuch as in
the contraction of the wall, a, b, its one end, b, that is
the cone of the heart, is carried towards c, because of
the simultaneous contraction ola, e, the septum ol
the beart, that wall is, in its contractiori, carried
outwards to d, and forms the line a, d, c, which,
although shorter than the line, a, i, b, still rises as a
tumour at d. The distention of the wall is to no
small extent due to the impulse of the blood which,

Should any one ask here how the blood cor 'ned
within the contracted ventricle, a, d, c, is expe d
from it (for it is not to be supposed that in the systo
of the heart the extreme part ol the heart moves
quite up to the base of the heart, but that some space
remains between them),l answer that it has not yet
been established that all the blood leaves the
ventricles each time that they contract. And at
any rate, if the ventricles of the heart were nearly
emptied of blood it would seem that what remains of
the blood could not be compressed by them with
force sufficient lor the projection ot the blood to the
furthest members of the body. If, however, all the
blood is expelled from the ventricles, we must suppose
that the walls of the ventricles continue their
contractiori for some little time after that first rush
of the heart by which the pulsation is started. For
otherwise it seems impossible that all the blood
should be driven by the beat of the heart so
instantaneously into the great artery. And it tells
in favour ol this, that in the section of animab, when
the dying heart is opened, the movement of contraction
is seen to be completed not at one stroke, but to
