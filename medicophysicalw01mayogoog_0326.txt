begin in the septum and be gradually propagated in
the walls of the ventricles. No doubt, for first setting
the blood in motion there is need of a powerful con·
traction and jump of the whole heart; while yet a
more gentle constriction of the ventricles may suffice
for keeping it going.

For the further expulsion of the blood from the
beart, its septum and ventricles contract not only
as to their length but also as to their breadth ; for the
fissures or little excavations with which the cavities
of the heart are hollowed out, have a position which
suits the heart when constricted from all sides, as the
eminent Lower has noticed. And it tells in favour
of this that the fibres of the heart are attached all
round to the orifice of the great artery; whence it
comes that in their contractiori they pull the sides of
that orifice in all directions and open a wide· door for
the blood bursting out.

N or should we omit to state that the long diameter
of the septum of the heart is not straight, but is
gibbous and convex on the right3 but in respect of
the left ventricle it is concave, or at least plane3 as
is shown in Plate III.‚ Fig. 9. Now this form of the
septum conduces in no small degree to the propulsion
of the blood from the left ventricle to the remotest
parts of the body; for when the wall of the right
ventricle contracts, the blood thus compressed pushes
against the convex side of the septum, and the septum
meanwhile contracting by its own force, becomes
straighter, and still further narrows the space of the
left ventricle, as may be seen in Plate 111.‚ Fig. 9.
So that, iu fact, the pressure of the contracting right
ventricle also contributes no little to the contrac-
tion of the lef .

lt is further to be noted that as the contracted
