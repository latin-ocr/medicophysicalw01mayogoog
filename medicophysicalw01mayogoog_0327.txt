septum is thus made more nearly plane, the heart as
a whole is carried to the left, as may be seen in the
figure. For when a motion has been once impressed

on the heart it continues for some time, in accordance
with the nature 01 projectiles; and thus it comes
about that the heart brought to the left, strikes the
1011 side 01 the chest forcibly, though the greater
thickness 01 1110 wall 01 1110 1011 ventricle‚ its more
powerlul pulse, not to mention its very shape, so
different from that 01 the right ventricle‚ contribute
in no small degree to this effect. And to these
things Ι may add that the spiral libres in the walls of
the left ventriele are so arranged that, when they
contract, the heart is twisted by them, so that the
right ventricle is carried backwards towards the spine,
and the leit somewhat forwards towards the chest‚ so
as to strike it.

From what has so lar been said it follows, that if
the blood cannot escape with sufficient freedom from
the ventricles 01 the beart, on account 01 an obstruc-
tion 01 any sort whatever,·either 01 1110 pulmonary
vessels or 01 the great artery, it cannot but be that,
as the heart violently contracts to expel as lar as may
be the load 01 blood, the walls 01 the ventricles are
widely distended into a ball, and in consequence the
heart is dashed violently against the chest; so that
the ribs are sometimes pushed out by its blows.
And it may be supposed that palpitation 01 the
heart, especially when long continued, proceeds from ’
this cause ; for although in this affection the pulsation
01 the heart is very violent, still the pulse 01 the
arteries at the wrist is usually quite languid3 as has
been observed by others as well as by ourselves.
BesideS, it points in this direction that in the bodies
01 persons who have died 01 palpitation 01 1110 heart.
