the blood-vessels of the lungs, and also to some extent
the great artery, are sometimes found obstructed and
almost closed by the accretion of cartilage in their
interior, or by clots of blood, and the ventricles of
the heart, or at least one of them, inordinately
distended with grumous blood.

, In confirmation of what has just been said, Ι may
here submit an observation made not long since by
the learned and ingenious Dr Thomas Millington,
who has kindly given me an account of it, as
follows,

A young man of good position, about twenty years
of age, of a delicate and slender habit of body,
suffered for some years from palpitation of the beart,
which was so violent that the ribs were forced out-
wards by the heart's impact, and a quite notable
tumour was formed on the left side of the chest3

and if the hand were placed on it, the heart could be
felt violently dashed against the thorax, and one
could, so to speak, hold it in the hand. But yet the
pulse of the arteries in the wrist was very languid.

I can myself testify that this was the ease with the
said patient.

Moreover this patient became breathless and suf-
fered from violent palpitation and faintness after any
brisker movement. And at last, after a long drive in
a carriage, he had a more violent attack, with frequent
swoons and coldness of the extremities‚ and died. On
opening the body the heart was found tumid, especially
its right ventricle, which was larger than usual and
turgid with coagulated blood; indeed its muscular
wall was very thick and strong. Further, the
pulmonary artery and vein were distended with
grumous blood, and that vein, where it opens into
the left ventricle of the heart, was nearly closed by
