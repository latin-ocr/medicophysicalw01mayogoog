cartilage adhering to its interior, so that blood could
scarcely enter the ventricle. Indeed, there can be no
doubt that the obstruction of tbe pulmonary vein
was tbe cause not only of tbe palpitation from which
tbe patient suffered, but also of the above-mentioned
phenomena. For as the blood could not, on account
ol the obstruction, pass into the left ventricle of the
beart, ,the pulmonary blood-vessels and also the right
ventricle were necessarily distended with blood. So,
too, the beart, aud especially that ventricle, was
forced to contract violently so as to propel the mass
of the blood as much as possible through the lungs
into the left ventricle ol the beart. And this also
accounts for the great thickness and strength of the
right ventricle, since nruscles accustomed to more
violent exercise increase more than others. But that
the beart should have been dashed against the left
side of the obest with such violence that its ribs were
bent outwards, although it was the right ventricle of
the beart only that was swollen like a tumour, is to
be explained by what bas been said above ; for, indeed,
as tbe blood could not be all expelled from the right
ventricle because ol tbe aforesaid obstruction, it,
compressed by the violent contractiori of the muscular
wall ol that ventricle, drove the septum of the beart
and so also the beart itself to tbe left side, as we bave
shown above.

It is also to be noted that palpitatiou of the beart,
such, namely, as occurs suddenly and unexpectedly,
may corne from this, that the blood, strongly
fermenting and set in violent motion, rushes too
quickly into the ventricles oi the beart, so that tbe
beart must needs contract with more tban its usual

force to expel the greater quantity ol blood. For it ,

must not be forgotten tbat tbe beart, like other
