The other effect of respiration is that the nitro·
ae'rial particles should, by means of the blood, be
carried to the brain in quantity sufficient for the
renewal and completion of the animal spirits ς and
unless that takes place, a failure of the spirits and
swooning will soon follow on the suppression of the
other respiration-that of the hrain.

HOWJUMPING IS PRODUCED

We shall add here as a corollary something as

to that motion by which animals lift themselves
altogether from the ground and jump. This motion
is produced, according to the view of the distinguished
Willis, not hythe contraction of muscles, but rather
by some elastic force. For, indeed, that learned man
says in his Answer to Dr Hzghmore—“lf there is no
attraction except to an immovable part, how can an
animal move its whole body and completely lift
itself from the ground: surely the motion of the
whole follows the motion of the individual motor
parts, wherefore if these can be drawn only one
towards another and not lift themselves wholly by
some elastic power, Ι confess that I do not understand
how and by what further artifices an animal is able
to lift itself as a whole and jump hither and thither.”
But I really cannot conceive what the learned man

. understands hyan elastic force of the organs: there

is, however, no reason why we should seek refuge in
it, for the motion of animals raising themselves from
the ground can be produced quite conveniently by
the contractiori of the extended muscles, as will be
made plain by what follows. For in Plare 111, Fig. 6,
let a, b, bea stick, which we shall suppose to be
