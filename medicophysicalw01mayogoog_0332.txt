rotated about a, as a centre; 1 say that while it is
moving in a circle, all the parts of it, say c, b, strive
as far as in them is to recede from the centres ol the
circles which they describe, and tend to move in the
straight lineS, c, e, and b, e: for a similar argument
holds here as in the case of a stone rotated in a sling,
which always strives to get out of the sling and to
. begin a movement in a straight line, as has long ago
been noted by the acute Descartes. But now if we
suppose that while the stick is in rotation it be set
free from the centre, a, when it has come to a
horizontal position, it will no longer move in a circle,
but ascend straight up. These things being premised,
let (in Plate 111, Fig. 7), a, e, be the tibia, c, n, the
thigh-bone, e, b, e, the muscles which extend the tibia ;
when the animal is in the attitude for jumping, the
thigh-bone, c, n, by the contractiori os these muscles
will be rotated about the protuberance of the tibia at
e, just as the aforesaid stick was rotated about the
centre. Whence it comes about that the thigh-bone
thus circumgyrated will strive to move up; and
indeed if it hasbeen driven round with sufficiently
brisk motion by these muscles, that effort will attain
its end, and the thigh-bone will carry the tibia alost
with it. And the case is quite similar with the
museles extending the foot, the tibia, the thigh, and
the back: when they contract strongly, the parts
into which they are inserted are driven in a circle
and carried upwards, as is seen in Plate 111, Fig. 8,
which shows the muscles extending the soot, the
tibia, the thigh, and the back, with the bones into
which they are inserted. The flexor muscles of the
arm, the forearm, and the hand have been drawn in
the figure because these muscles contributa not a
little to the lifting ol the body, in so sar of course as
