which they are until their state is changed by some
external cause. As to the impetus with which a
stone from a sling ora ball from a gun is projected,
we can suppose it to be nothing else than the very
rapid motion in which the projectiles were when
they emerged from the sling or the gun. But to give
an instance of what has been said, let us suppose a
pendulum let go at any point of the circle, while it
descends to the lowest point of the circle it does not
remain there at rest but mounts up to almost the
same height on the opposite side of the circle. But
what is it that causes this ascent os the pendulum?
For as to gravity‚ it is not its character to cause the
ascent but on the contrary the descent of things,
and yet in this case the gravity of the pendulum is
the cause of its ascent3 in so far as the pendulum
when it has come to the lowest point ol the circle
has aequired, on account of the continued impulse of
its own gravity‚ a so much accelerated motion that it
can carry itself up: for so much higher as is the
point from which the pendulum is let go, so much
higher does it ascend on the other side, and that
happens only because the pendulum,'let fall from a
higher point, acquires, at the lowest point of the
circle, a more rapid motion and thence also a greater
impressed force. Nor is the case otherwise when a
ball is discharged from a longer gun; for so it gains
a much accelerated motion, and in consequence also
a very great impressed force. Obwiously the ac-
celerated motion or the impressed force of a stone
descending from on high, and of a ball shot out of a
long gun, are increased for quite the same reason,
because, as the stone descends or the ball passes along
the gun, the impetus of gravity‚ or the impelling force,
is renewed every moment.
