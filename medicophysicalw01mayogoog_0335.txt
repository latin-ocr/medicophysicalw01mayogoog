302 Mayow

But to bring what has been said to bear upon the
present matter, when an animal is bent, so as to be
in a suitable position for jumping (and we note that
to begin jumping it is quite necessary that the animal
should first bend itself), and then the extensor muscles
contract all at once with a sufficiently powerful
impulse, it comes to pass that all the parts of the
animal are carried upwardS, as follows from what has
been said above: but in as far as all the parts of the
animal, and thus the animal itself‚ are, by the action
of the said muscIeS, set in motion upwardS, these
muscles carry the animal on high for the same reason
as projectiles are moved in any direction3 inasmuch
as the impressed force of projectiles is nothing else
than motion determined in a particular direction in
which the thing has been made to move by some
impelling cause. And so far as to muscular motion.
