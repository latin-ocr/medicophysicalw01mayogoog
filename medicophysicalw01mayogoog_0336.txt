authority of such a man, would have deterred me

forgive one who reverences the truth although he
may to some extent differ from him. Yet, as Ι hasten
with him to the same goal, it cannot but be that Ι shall
ior a great part of the way tread in his footsteps:
wherefore I¹ shall sometimes, with apologies to so
