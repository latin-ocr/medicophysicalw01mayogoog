indisposition to work and exercise; for the children
can only play sitting, and can scarcely stand on their .
feet, and at last, as the disease advances, the weak
neck can hardly sustain the weight ol the head.

Such and so many are the symptoms of this
disease; we have next to consider what is the evil
which is the fruitful parent of this numerous brood.

And in the first place we assume that the cause of
this disease does not consist in the access of vitiated
blood from the heart; for in this case the whole
mass os the blood would be corrupted, and as this is
indiscriminately distributed to all partS, the impure
blood would affect all parts equally, but this never
happens in this disease. For the head, as also the
viscera, except that they are larger than usual, are
healthy ; indeed the very parenchymata, which chiefly
⁴consist of affused blood, inasmuch as they closely
resemble those of healthy persons, testily that the
blood is sound: for it is absurd to assume some sort
of elective attraction in virtue of which the head and
the other healthy organs attract what is good in the
blood, but send away the bad blood to other parts:
for this attraction, if it existed, would be present
equally in all parts, as there is the same congruence '

with good blood and need of it in all parts3 and this '

is what is supposed to produce motion ol this sort.
Secondly, we assert that the origin of this affection
does not consist in a depraved constitution of the
parts themselves, as il parts suffering from intem-
perate cold and moisture were unfit to receive the
blood coming from the heart : for whence arises such
excessive moisture and coldness of some parts, when
all are similarly and equally irrigated by the spirits
of the warming blood? Nor do 1 think coldness
innate in the parts, but in them over and above their
