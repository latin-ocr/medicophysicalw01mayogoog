nature3 nor is it to be believed that the parts them-
selves resist their own nutrition. For they take no
active part in nutrition, but only passively receive the
nutriment brought to them ε so that I do not believe
in any unfitness in the parts, which would lead to their
being less nourished, but only that there are obstruc-
tions which prevent their reception of the aliment:
wherelore the cause of this disease cannot be in the
constitution of the parts themselves ; nor are we to
look on the moisture as the cause of this disease, but
rather as its consequence.

When, then, parts do indeed grow cold and are not
nourished, although saturated with quite suitable
blood, we must certainly conclude that something
besides blood alone is required for warmth and nutri·
tion. And whatever this may be, it must necessarily
be conveyed· by some sort of vessels. The arteries
bring the blood, the veins carry it back ; and the
nerves alone remain as possible carriers of the nutri-
tive juice, or, at all events, spirits. And lest any
one should doubt that the nerves carry something
required for nutrition, I shall mention an experiment
known to every one, namely, that if the nerve serving
any part whatever be divided, not only does sensation
in that part cease‚ but also nutrition so that the said
part withers up. ¹

But indeed this nervous juice does not alone per-
form the whole function of nutrition. For besides
it, the blood diffused by the arteries has no small
share in nutrition. For it is the case that the
nervous juice when mixed with the blood produces
a certain effervescence and heat‚ and thus suitable
material is precipitated for the nourishment ol the
parts: and so the blood in this disease, although in
itself laudable enough, yet lacking the necessary
