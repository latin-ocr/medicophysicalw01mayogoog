On Rickets ·3o7

ferment on account of the defect of this nervous
influx, is not able either to excite the required beat
in the parts or to perform the function of nutrition.

We need not, then, hesitate to assert that the
disease of rickets arises from an unequal distribution
of the nervous juice, from the defect of which, or
from its superabundance, some parts, defrauded os
nutriment, shrink, otherS, saturated more than
enough, grow to an excessive size.

The error causing this inequality does not lie with
the flow from the brain, for if this fountain were
vitiated no suitable nutriment could come to any
part: for indeed the head and the other parts which

Α are supplied by the cerebral nerves enjoy sufficiently

good nutriment, though more than enough of it.
And yet those parts which have nerves originating
in the spinal marrow, being defrauded of nutritive
juice, are emaciated. This is a clear prool thata
sufficient supply of vital spirits is elaborated in the
brain as in the public workshop of the whole body;
but that the spinal marrow, as the highway leading
from that emporium, is overlaid and obstructed by
thick and glutinous humours, so that the access of
nervous nutriment is cut off : whence it comes that

the nerves arising from the spinal marrow lacking .

that nutritious juice, bring no supply of it to the
languishing parts to which they are distributed.
Thus these parts suffer from atrophy and extreme
leanness. And it is thus reasonable that we should
assign this as the cause of the disease, specially as
all the symptoms proper to this disease can be clearly
and easily shown to be derivable from this source,
as shall be made plain in what follows.

1. It happens in this disease that the head increases
in size beyond the just proportion; and this is what
