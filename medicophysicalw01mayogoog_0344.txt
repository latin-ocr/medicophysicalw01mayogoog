pillar will therefore be inclined to the left, as is seen-

in the same figure. But if the pillar is made of
many stones, and a wedge is inserted, as described,
between every pair of them, the stones will not have
the form of a pillar but of a portion of an arc, as may
be seen in F ig. 3.

“ To accommodate this to the present question, if the
said bones are more fully nourished on one side and
therefore grow more on that side than on the
opposite, it must necessarily follow that they will on
that very account curve, for the fuller nutrition of
that side brings about the curvature of the bone in
the same way as the wedge driven in brings about
the curvature of the pillar, except that while a wedge
is driven in at certain points only of the side of the

pillar, the fuller nutrition affects the side of the bone ’

nearly equally along its whole length, and it is on
account of this uniform nutrition that the inclination
of the bone produces an exact segment of a circle
without any angles.”

According to this hypothesis, viz, that one side
is more fully nourished, the learned author by his
ingenious comment demonstrates the curvature of the
bones. But with all respect for such a man we may
ask, whence comes it that one side should have that
fuller nutrition when the blood by which the bones
are nourished is in this disease, no less than in healthy
persons, equally distributed? And if there were any
such inequality, a fuller supply of aliment might be
supposed in the posterior side of the tibia, as that is
less exposed to cold, and so soher, and thus the
posterior would be the elongated and convex side of
the curved tibia, and the anterior the concave3 but
the opposite is the case, for in this disease the tibia
is prominent in front.
