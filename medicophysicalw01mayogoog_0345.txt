And further, from the very form of the curved
bones, we may gather that they grow equally on
both sides: for the bones have the form shown in·
Fig. 4, which represents the tibia, where the concave
side, a, is as long as the convert, b, for if it were
otherwise, and the tibia had the form shown in Fig.
5, the thigh-bone, b, could not be supported on it with·
out manifest obliquity of the body, as may be seen
from the figure.

We must, therefore, look for some other cause of
this curvature; and to see our way more clearly, the
following points should be noted :-

Ist. We assert that in this disease the bones are
not to be reckoned among the parts affected in
respect to nutrition, for these are nourished and grow
no less than in healthy persons, as observation shows ;
for the blood alone suffices for their nutrition, and
there does not seem to be any need of the nervous
juice as in the nutrition of other parts; for as bones
are not supposed to have any sensation of themselveS,
¹ they must be held to have little or nothing to do
with nerves.

and. We take it for granted that in this disease,
the nervous and muscular parts do not grow at all
because of the lack of the nervous juice necessary for
their nutrition.

These things being premised, let a in Plate lv,
Fig. 6, be the tibia, b the muscles attached to that
bone behind and forming the calf. As, then, the tibia,
a, grows and lengthens, while at the same time it
is held, as by a string, hythe muscleS, which do not

grow in the same proportion, it follows necessarily
that that bone, strained by the shorter fibres of the
muscles, should be bent like a bow. Imay illustrate
this hypothesis of mine by an example. If a string
