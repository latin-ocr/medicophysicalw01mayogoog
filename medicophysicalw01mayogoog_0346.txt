be tied above and below to a young and growing
tree, yet so that the tree is not strained by the string,
as is shown in Plate IV., F ig. 7, every one will admit
that the said trec will be bent as it grows, asin Plate
1v.‚Fig. 8. And the mathematical proof of this is
obvious, for if any line is elongated while its extremi-
ties remain fixed, the line will cease to be a straight
line, and this is what happens to the bones in this
disease.

’ And this may be further confirmed by the fact that

the bent bones always have their concave side turned ψ

towards the attached muscle, just as a bow and its
string, as may be seen in the case of the tibia, which
is prominent and convex in front, but concave on
the posterior side which looks towards the muscles;

, and the same is the case with the other bones-no

invalid argument that the bones are bent by the
muscles just as the bow by its string.

And this gives us the reason why quacks regularly
and successfully apply friction to the concave and
not to the convex side of the bones; for hythe more
plentiful supply of nutritious juice which such friction
calls forth, the muscle situated on the concave side
of the bone is nourished and grows, so that it is not
surprising that when the string is elongated the bone
strained and bent by it is also relaxed and becomes
straighter. And this is the reason why persons who
have recovered from this disease grow very much iu
height; for the bones not only grow as in other
persons, but in their return from curvature to straight-
,ness are more elongated.

The spine is also variously bent, partly inwards,
partly outwards; and this arises from the various
position of the muscles in different parts of the spine,
for the spine in its upper part is curved inwards by
