points, because this is the only mode of growth left ¹

free to them, as is shown in Fig. 11, in which a, a
are ribs, the extremities of which, b, d, grow outwards
in points, for they cannot be bent in, as this would
be still more opposed to their natural position.

To this kind of narrowness of the chest the muscles
of the abdomen also contribute in no small degree,
because, being, as we have said, extenuated and tense,
they thus draw down the lower ribs to which they
are attached, and so narrow the chest. ’

By quite a similar line of reasoning we could illus-
trate the disorders of the other bones; for instance,
the bones of the articulation in the wrist and in the
anhle, which, on account of their shortness‚ cannot
be bent, form protuberant nodes. But what has been
said may suffice as to the curvature of the bones.

6. The above-mentioned narrowness of the chest
would lead us to expect that the lungs, not having
space for expansion, should be stufsed up with
grumous blood and swelled, as indeed they are, hence
they sometimes become purulent and the pleurae are
often adherent; hence also the patients suffer from
asthma and difficulty of breathing.

7. As to the very great bodily weakness and in-
capacity for any movement in this disease, while the
emaciation of the muscles contributes something
to this symptom, yet this alone does not seem suffi-
cient, for the weakness is out of proportion to the
emaciation of the muscles, for the patients cannot
stand on their feet, nor, as the disease progresses,
sustain the weight of their head. So that we must
look for some other cause of such weakness, and this
can be nothing else than deficiency of animal spirits,
necessarily consequent on the above-mentioned
obstructions of the nerves. For animal spirits are
