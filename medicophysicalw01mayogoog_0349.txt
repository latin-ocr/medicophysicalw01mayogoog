And s0, in fine, we have deduced the symptoms
of this disease from obstruction of the spinal marrow,
as its source. J '

And here it may be asked how it comes about that
older persons are never attacked by this disease,
seeing that they, as well as infants, suffer from obstrue-¹
tion of nerveS, as in paralysis and other diseases of
that kind. Ι answer that although perhaps children
are chiefly liable to this disease, yet adults sometimes
suffer from the same disorder under another name.
Yet that the above-described symptoms for the most ι
part never appear in older patients, arises from a
difference not of disease but of age. For as the
great size of the head, the curvature of the bones,
and some other of the symptoms are produced by the
abnormal increase in size of parts, it is altogether
impossible that adults, already at the limit of growth,
i.e., unable to grow any more at all, should grow
abnormally: so that in adults suffering lrorn this
disease the head does not, as in children, increase
beyond its proper size, because the head has already
attained the limit of growth which the very laws ol
nature forbid it to exceed. But while the parts
cannot increase abnormally in adults, still the disease
does the one thing that in their case it can, by
emaciating them.

As to the prognosis‚ this disease is usually not
lethal in itself3 yet sometimes by the aggravation of
the symptoms it degenerates into Phthisis, Tabes,
Hectic Fever, Dropsy of the Lungs or AsciteS, and so
at last is fatal to the patient. But the prognosis can
be more easily established by the following rules :—
