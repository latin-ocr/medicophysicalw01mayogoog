On Ricketr 321

and repeat it two or three times at intervals of about
seven days. Although practical men make much of
this kind of scarification, I .do not know whether
leeches would not do as well, or even better. For
Ι do not think that the leeches by their sucking
would cause any increased flow of blood to the head.
For whatever blood comes by their suction to the
part to which they are applied is removed by the
suctiou itsell ; and as to the increased flow of blood
caused by the depletion of the blood-vessels, that
occurs in venesection as well.

Further, in this disorder issues are of special use,
particularly an issue between the first and second
cervical vertebrae, lor in that position, close to the
origin ol the disease‚ it has the greater efficacy.
And the usefulness of issues consists in this, that they
largely contribute to the evacuation of the super-
fluous serosity of the brain, and so to the diminution
of its abnormal size, and also to the drying up of the
excessive humidity of the spinal marrow, and conse-
quently to the strengthening of the nerves thence
arising. A seton can supply the place of an issue.

As to blisters, there can be no doubt that, placed
over the vertebrae of the neck or behind the ears,
they will bring relief 3 but their action is suddenly
put forth, and their frequent use seems to be too
troublesome and painful to the children.

Further, cupping without scarification, applied
along the spine, seems to be ol no small importance
for correcting the humid and frigid condition of the
spinal marrow and for removing the torpor of the
nerves. Indeed, 1 think cupping, even with slight
scarification, should sometimes be used close to the
upper cervical vertebrae.
