produced: although sometimes purgatiori and also
vomiting (which when gently brought on has proved
very serviceable) may be used. Ι1 the tooth is about
to pierce the gum, nurses are used to rub it with a
stick 01 polished coral: instead 01 that, the root 01
Althea or of Lapathus acutus may be used. It is even
sometimes right to make 3 way 101 the coming tooth
by means 01 311 incisiou. Also epispastic plasters
behind the ears bring relief. Yet if pain and sleep·
lessness call 101 hypnotics, syrup 01 poppies may be
given in a dose 01 one to two drachms.

Besides intemal medicines and surgical care, external
appliances will also be employed. Among these
are to be reckoned exercises 01 311 kinds. 11 the
strength permits it, ·walking is much to be used.
But often the children play sitting, andare exercised
by being carried ou the nurses' arms and by being

rocked in the cradle. For exercise promotes the flow
01 blood and of animal spirits also to the muscular
parts, and thus heat is produced in these enfeebled
parts, as the mass of the blood is forced into swifter

motion by the contraction 01 the muscles, and is
impregnated with fermentative particles in the lungs
by the respiration made more intense by the exercise ;
while 011 the other hand the blood becomes thick
by constant repose and is made litter 101 producing
obstructions

Further, rubbings are 01 110 5111311 moment in curing
this disease: they may be made with warm woollen
cloths· The parts to be rubbed are the spine, which,
as has been shown above, is primarily at fault; also
the muscular parts, yet with this cauti0n‚ that there is
to be no rubbing where the bones are prominent, but
the concave parts 01 the bones are to be more liberally
rubbed: the reason 101 this has been given above.
