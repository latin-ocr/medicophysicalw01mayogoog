Ceroe. s. q. pro emplastro conficiendo. A sufficient portion
of this is to be spread on leather‚ the shape of which
may be varied: for as the upper or the lower parts
are weak the plaster is to be applied to the upper
or to the lower parts of the spine, sometimes, indeed,
to its whole length. So far of the method of treat-
